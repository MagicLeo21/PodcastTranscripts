## Canceling an Appointment

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you another great lesson about appointments. 

**Erica:** That's right. We've got an elementary lesson about canceling an appointment. 

**Marco:** It's a really common situation… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Sometimes you have an appointment at the doctor's or something. 

**Erica:** Or at work. 

**Marco:** And you have to cancel it. 

**Erica:** Yes, so we're gonna learn some great language to help you cancel appointments today. Let's go straight to the dialogue then. We're going to be listening as Samantha and Angela have a phone conversation and Angela is trying to cancel an appointment. 

**Marco:** And it's gonna be a little bit fast in the beginning, but when we come back, we will explain all the great vocabulary. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

> A: Hello, Samantha speaking.

> B: Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling.

> A: Oh, hi Angela, what's up?

> B: I'm just calling about our meeting today. I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon? I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

> A: Let me see, it shouldn't be too much of a problem…

> B: I'm really sorry, I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much, it's just this thing came up, and …

> A: Angela, you know what, I can't make it to our meeting, either. Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

> B: Sounds great. See you tomorrow.

> C: Angela…Angela, look up! See that lady over there who is trying on a red leather jacket? Isn't that Samantha?

> B: What? No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me…

**Marco:** Okay, we have some really interesting words that you've probably listened to in this dialogue, so… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Let's start with "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Today on language takeaway we're brining you three words. Ah, Erica, what's the first one? 

**Erica:** The first word is reschedule. 

**Marco:** Reschedule. 

**Erica:** Reschedule. 

**Marco:** Reschedule. 

**Erica:** When you reschedule an appointment, you… 

**Marco:** Change it for another day or time. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Great, the second word that we have is inconvenience. 

**Erica:** Inconvenience. 

**Marco:** Inconvenience. 

**Erica:** Inconvenience. 

**Marco:** So, to inconvenience someone is to… 

**Erica:** To make things not convenient for that person. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright. So, to make things a little bit difficult… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or to make things a little bit, uh… 

**Erica:** Uncomfortable. 

**Marco:** Uncomfortable. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Inconvenience. 

**Erica:** And our third word is… 

**Marco:** Postpone. 

**Erica:** Postpone. 

**Marco:** Postpone. 

**Erica:** Postpone. We have some examples of the word postpone that will help you to understand its meaning a little bit better. Let's listen. 

**Example One** 

> A: Since Robert is late again, we have to postpone the meeting. 

**Example Two** 

> B: I'm sorry Simon, but your vacation has been postponed until next month. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Unfortunately, the flight will be postponed. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, basically, postpone is to delay. 

**Erica:** That's right. Make it at a latter time. 

**Marco:** At a latter time. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, some great words there and, ah, we can listen to our dialogue a second time at a slower speed. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

> A: Hello, Samantha speaking.

> B: Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling.

> A: Oh, hi Angela, what's up?

> B: I'm just calling about our meeting today. I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon? I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

> A: Let me see, it shouldn't be too much of a problem…

> B: I'm really sorry, I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much, it's just this thing came up, and …

> A: Angela, you know what, I can't make it to our meeting, either. Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

> B: Sounds great. See you tomorrow.

> C: Angela…Angela, look up! See that lady over there who is trying on a red leather jacket? Isn't that Samantha?

> B: What? No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me…

**Erica:** Alright, so, in this dialogue we had some really great phrases that we should look at in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** We have three phrases for you today in fluency builder and the first one is so common, it's a great phrase – what's up? 

**Marco:** What's up? 

**Erica:** What's up! 

**Marco:** Hehe. So, this is a very common way of saying "hi". 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** What's up? 

**Erica:** How's it going? What's going on? 

**Marco:** Right, and now the interesting thing is it… th… many people don't know how to answer this phrase. 

**Erica:** Yes, I see this all the time with my students. 

**Marco:** So, if you say "what's up", you should say… 

**Erica:** Not much. 

**Marco:** Not much. 

**Erica:** Nothing. 

**Marco:** Nothing. So, what's up? 

**Erica:** Not much. Hehe. 

**Marco:** Not much. Hehe. Alright, so the next time someone's tell you "what's up", now you know what to answer. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, our second phrase is can't make it. 

**Erica:** Can't make it. 

**Marco:** I can't make it. 

**Erica:** We use this phrase when we want to say "I cannot attend", I… 

**Marco:** I cannot make it. 

**Erica:** Yeah, I can't come. 

**Marco:** Right, so, if you're having a party today, I say "oh, I'm sorry, I can't make it". 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Ah, it means I can't go. 

**Erica:** Exactly. Maybe one more example: so, Marco, we've got a meeting today at three o'clock. 

**Marco:** I can't make it, I'm recording today. 

**Erica:** Oh, okay. 

**Marco:** Hehe. So, can't make it. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Our last word for fluency builder – this thing came up. 

**Erica:** This thing came up. 

**Marco:** This thing came up. 

**Erica:** This is a great way of giving an excuse for why you can't make it… 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** ???. 

**Marco:** So… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** I can't make today, because this thing came up. Like something… 

**Erica:** Something happened. 

**Marco:** Something happened. 

**Erica:** Yeah. Let's listen to a few examples of this phrase, so we can see how it's used in the wild. 

**Example One** 

> A: I'm sorry that I'm late, this thing came up at work and I had to stay to take care of it. 

**Example Two** 

> B: I can't talk right now, something came up. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Sorry I missed the meeting, something came up. 

**Marco:** Okay, great examples and I guess it's perfectly clear now. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to our dialogue a third time and now we're ready to understand everything. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

> A: Hello, Samantha speaking.

> B: Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling.

> A: Oh, hi Angela, what's up?

> B: I'm just calling about our meeting today. I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon? I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

> A: Let me see, it shouldn't be too much of a problem…

> B: I'm really sorry, I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much, it's just this thing came up, and …

> A: Angela, you know what, I can't make it to our meeting, either. Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

> B: Sounds great. See you tomorrow.

> C: Angela…Angela, look up! See that lady over there who is trying on a red leather jacket? Isn't that Samantha?

> B: What? No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me…

**Marco:** So, Erica, have you ever canceled an appointment like this, uh, under false pretenses? 

_[NOTE: or by false pretenses; doing something under/by false pretences means making sort of an intentional misrepresentation in order to obtain anything]_ 

**Erica:** So, for… for fake reasons? 

**Marco:** For a fake reason… to shopping. 

**Erica:** Um, well, I may not have… you know, told my boss "oh, I can't make it to a meeting, because this thing came up" and then I really was going shopping… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** I… I've never done that. 

**Marco:** Hm. 

**Erica:** But how about you, Marco? 

**Marco:** Well, you know in Ecuador soccer's a really big thing. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** So, um, when we were playing in the World Cup… Ecuador was playing and… 

**Erica:** Not you, but… 

**Marco:** Well, no like… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** The… the Ecuadorian soccer team. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** I canceled an appointment, because I was gonna go watch the game. 

**Erica:** Really… 

**Marco:** Yeah 

**Erica:** A business appointment? 

**Marco:** A business appointment. 

**Erica:** Well, I guess that's okay. 

**Marco:** Yeah, I mean it was like the first time we were ever in the World Cup and, you know, my boss didn't really put up much of a fight, because I guess he also wanted to go watch the game. 

**Erica:** So, very similar to the… events in this dialogue. 

**Marco:** Very similar. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** I guess that's kind of the inspiration behind it.
