## Turn the Left

---

**Erica:** Hello English learners! And welcome to EnglishPod! My name's Erica and I'm here with… Marco? Marco, hurry up! 

**Marco:** I'm coming! 

**Erica:** Hurry up, Marco, we've got a lesson! 

**Marco:** Oh, okay, I'm here, I'm here, what did I miss? 

**Erica:** Uh, the lesson. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, sorry about that. Um, we have a great lesson for you today. We have an elementary lesson. 

**Erica:** That's right, an elementary lesson about being in a rush and about giving directions when you're in a car. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** We're going to listen to two friends who are getting in a car and they're getting ready to go somewhere and they're in a big hurry. So, let's hurry up and listen to the dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** So, they were in a hurry and it was all just to get to the library. 

**Erica:** Well, maybe he was late returning a book or something. 

**Marco:** Hehe. That's a bit dramatic just for returning a book. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, why don't we look at our "language takeaway" for today? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Okay, on today's language takeaway we have five words for you today, five really important and useful words that we found in our dialogue. So, let's take a look at the first one – step on it. 

**Erica:** Step on it. 

**Marco:** Step on it. 

**Erica:** Step on it. 

**Marco:** So, what does it mean when I tell you to step on it? 

**Erica:** Drive faster. 

**Marco:** Drive faster, right? 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Step on it. 

**Erica:** Exactly, you might also say "speed up". 

**Marco:** Speed up, yes. 

**Erica:** Speed up. 

**Marco:** That's exactly it! Our second word – speed up. 

**Erica:** Also means "go faster". 

**Marco:** Go faster. And what about the opposite? 

**Erica:** You might say "slow down". 

**Marco:** Slow down. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, speed up and slow down. 

**Erica:** So, our third word for today is having a fit. 

**Marco:** Having a fit. 

**Erica:** Having a fit. 

**Marco:** Having a fit. 

**Erica:** Well, this a funny phrase and I think listening to a few examples of this phrase might help us understand its meaning a little bit better. 

**Example One** 

> A: Jeez! You don't need to have a fit. Nothing is going to happen if we're five minutes late. 

**Example Two** 

> B: My boss is going to have a fit if I don't finish this on time. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Oh, I almost had a fit when my boss told me I had to work this weekend. 

**Marco:** Okay, great examples. So, Erica, why don't you tell me what does it mean when you have a fit? 

**Erica:** It means you get really angry and you can't control your emotions. So, maybe you start screaming and maybe some steam comes out of your ears. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, that's having a fit. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Excellent. Okay, let's take a look at our next word now – cut through. 

**Erica:** Cut through. 

**Marco:** Cut through. 

**Erica:** Cut through. 

**Marco:** When you cut through something, it means you just… 

**Erica:** Go through. 

**Marco:** Go through. 

**Erica:** Yeah, quite simple. It… it gives you the idea that you go through something quickly. 

**Marco:** Quickly, so, I can say "let's cut through the park". 

**Erica:** Yep, or "let's cut through the backyard". 

**Marco:** Okay, go through. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And this takes us to our last word for today – shortcut. 

**Erica:** Shortcut. 

**Marco:** Shortcut. 

**Erica:** Shortcut. 

**Marco:** This is a really common word and not many people know about it. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you're right, it's two simple words that when you fit them together, the meaning changes. It's… it's a great example of this real English we talk about. 

**Marco:** And it means to take a shorter way somewhere. 

**Erica:** Exactly, so, if I take a shortcut, I go the short way. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, going back just a little bit to cut through. If I cut through the park, that's basically a shortcut. 

**Erica:** Exactly! 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Now it's clear. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Now it's time to listen to our dialogue again, but this time it's gonna be slower, so then we can understand all these words that we just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Okay, well, I think that was a lot more clear this time. You know, there's some great language in that dialogue and I would like to look at how we can "put it together". 

**Putting It Together** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, today on putting it together we have three phrases for you. 

**Erica:** And we're gonna show you how you can use these phrases like a native speaker. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, all of these phrases we heard in the dialogue. Why don't we start with the first one? Make a… 

**Erica:** Make a… 

**Marco:** So, in the dialogue they say "make a left here". 

**Erica:** Yeah, and we can extend this phrase to say make a right. 

**Marco:** Uhu. That would be the equivalent of saying "turn left". 

**Erica:** Or "turn right". 

**Marco:** Turn right. And there's one more – make a U-turn. 

**Erica:** Exactly, that means turn the car a hundred and eighty degrees, all the way around. 

**Marco:** Make a U-turn. 

**Erica:** So, make a left, make a right, make a U-turn. 

**Marco:** Uhu. If you ever are in a taxi and you're telling the taxi driver where to go, this is the perfect way: make a left here, make a right there. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, let's move to our second phrase and it is are you nuts? 

**Marco:** Are you nuts? 

**Erica:** Are you nuts? So, this is a great way of saying… 

**Marco:** Are you crazy? 

**Erica:** Are you insane? 

**Marco:** Are you mad? 

**Erica:** So, when would we use a phrase like this? 

**Marco:** If somebody has a bad idea that you don't agree with, you would say "are you crazy?" or "are you nuts?" 

**Erica:** So, Marco, let's stop this podcast right now! 

**Marco:** Are you nuts? 

**Erica:** Okay, I think that's a good example of how we can use this phrase. 

**Marco:** Yes. 

**Erica:** So, are you nuts? Are you insane? Are you mad? 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to some examples of are you nuts? 

**Example One** 

> A: You wanna get married now? Are you nuts? You only met up three weeks ago. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Are you nuts? I'm not going to cheat on the exam. What if I get caught? 

**Erica:** So, I think that's clear and now we can move to our third phrase which is let's take a side street. 

**Marco:** Let's take a side street. 

**Erica:** Let's take a side street. 

**Marco:** Again, so, if you're in a taxi, this is a great way to suggest a route. 

**Erica:** Or suggest a direction. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So, we can take this phrase and extend it out with a few more words. We might say "let's take Wilson Avenue". 

**Marco:** Right, or "let's take the highway". 

**Erica:** So, let's take a side street, let's take Wilson Avenue, let's take the freeway. 

**Marco:** Okay, so now, let's take a listen to this dialogue a third time at its normal speed and now you can understand everything that's in this dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Erica:** Well, this dialogue is all about driving, right? 

**Marco:** Yes. 

**Erica:** And in North America where both of us are from… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Uh, driving is everything. 

**Marco:** Everybody has a car. 

**Erica:** When did you get a car? 

**Marco:** I… well, my car I got when I was like… maybe… nineteen. 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** But I learned how to drive and I was driving already by the age of sixteen. 

**Erica:** Yeah, that's the thing, in many countries you have to wait till I think you're eighteen to drive, but, uh, in North America everyone has a driver's license by the time they're sixteen years old. 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah, I guess everything is so far away that you need a car. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's a lot less likely to have, uh, subways or trains to travel by in North America. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, now you have all the tools necessary to give directions the next time you're in a car or in a taxi. 

**Erica:** Well, everyone, I really hope you enjoyed this lesson. Now, I want to remind you all to come to our EnglishPod website at englishpod.com and here you'll find a lot of tools to help you understand our podcasts better. So, with that, until next time… this is good bye! 

**Marco:** Bye!
