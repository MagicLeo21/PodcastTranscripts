## Buying a Car

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you another great lesson for all of you, who are interested in shopping. 

**Erica:** Especially those of you, who are interested in shopping for a car. 

**Marco:** A car. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Exactly. So, we're gonna give you some great language about describing a car or characteristics of a car. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And also some really interesting language for shopping. 

**Erica:** Yes, especially buying something really big and expensive. 

**Marco:** Yeah, like a car. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, before we listen to our dialogue let's take a look at "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Marco:** On vocabulary preview today we're brining two words. The first one is vehicle. 

**Erica:** Vehicle. 

**Marco:** Vehicle. 

**Erica:** Vehicle. 

**Marco:** So, again a vehicle is a machine, right? 

**Erica:** Right, a machine that carries people from one place to another. 

**Marco:** So, it's important to say that a vehicle could be an airplane… 

**Erica:** A car. 

**Marco:** A car. 

**Erica:** A boat. 

**Marco:** Boat. 

**Erica:** Even a bicycle. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** That's a vehicle. Our second word is sedan. 

**Erica:** Sedan. 

**Marco:** Sedan. 

**Erica:** Sedan. 

**Marco:** So, a sedan is a type of car. 

**Erica:** Exactly. It… it's a type of car with four doors that can fit five people inside. 

**Marco:** So, to make it more clear, most taxies are sedans. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** They have four doors. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Five people can fit in there… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Including the driver. Except taxies in Mexico. 

**Erica:** They're not sedans? 

**Marco:** They're little Beetles. 

**Erica:** Oh. 

**Marco:** The Volkswagen Beetles. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, those are not sedans. But, yeah, most, uh, countries have sedans as taxies. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** To give you some examples, like a Toyota Corolla or a Toyota Camry is a sedan. 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. Maybe like, uh, a Volkswagen Getta is that a…. 

**Marco:** A Jetta, yeah… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** A Jetta is the sedan. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Now, we could listen to our dialogue and it's gonna be at a normal speed, the first time, but you don't have to worry about it. 

**Erica:** We'll come back and teach you some of the important words from the dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

> A: Hi there, can I help you folks?

> B: I'm just browsing; seeing what's on the lot. My daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know how it is.

> C: Dad! I'm sixteen already and I'm, like, the only one at school who doesn't have a car!

> A: She is right, you know. Kids these days all have cars. Let me show you something we just got in: a 1996 sedan. Excellent gas mileage, it has dual airbags and anti lock brakes; a perfect vehicle for a young driver.

> C: Dad, I love it! It's awesome! Can we get this one please?

> B: I see… What can you tell me about this one?

> A: Oh, that's just an old World War Two tank that we use for TV commercials. Now about this sedan…

> B: Whoa, whoa wait a minute. Tell me more about this tank.

> A: Well, Sir, if you are looking for quality and safety then look no further! Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short range missile attacks.

> B: Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

> A: It does not.

> B: Well, I don't know. Let me sleep on it.

> A: Did I mention the tank is a tank?

> B: I'll take it!

> C: Dad!

**Marco:** I think she's really lucky. She's… 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** She's getting a tank to go to school. How awesome is that? 

**Erica:** Uh, I would be so embarrassed if I had to drive to school on a tank. 

**Marco:** That's like the coolest car. 

**Erica:** Oh, you're such a boy. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, a surprising ending to, uh, relatively easy shopping day. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Uh, let's take a look at some… language that we saw in our dialogue on "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** We have four words for you today. The first one is gas mileage. 

**Marco:** Gas mileage. 

**Erica:** Gas mileage. 

**Marco:** Gas mileage. So, gas mileage is how many miles you can travel on a gallon or liter of gasoline. 

**Erica:** Well, you know, it's interesting in some English speaking countries like Australia, New Zeeland, Canada, we use kilometers… 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** To measure distance. But we still talk about gas mileage. 

**Marco:** Uh. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I guess you can't say gas kilomiliage. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** Or… or some like that. But, yeah, it's… yeah, basically, how many kilometers or how many miles you can travel on a tank or on a liter or gallon of gas. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** The next word is airbags. 

**Marco:** Airbags. 

**Erica:** Airbags. 

**Marco:** Airbags. 

**Erica:** These are like big bags of air that fill up and come out of the car when there's a crash. 

**Marco:** Right, so, that way you don't hit your head against… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** The steering wheel or… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Something like that. 

**Erica:** So, they protect you. 

**Marco:** Right, I've heard that Volvo has like eighteen airbags now in their cars. 

**Erica:** They are very safe cars, you know. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Like a big balloon. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Okay, our third word today is brakes. 

**Erica:** Brakes. 

**Marco:** Brakes. 

**Erica:** Brakes. So, what are brakes? 

**Marco:** Brakes are little… What are breaks? Breaks are what make your car stop. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, that the little machines maybe that stop your car. 

**Marco:** Yeah, they're on the wheels. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** They make your car stop. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** You have brakes on your bike. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** On your car, etcetera. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Our last word today on language takeaway – reinforced. 

**Erica:** Reinforced. 

**Marco:** Reinforced. 

**Erica:** Reinforced. 

**Marco:** So, we have some examples of how we use reinforced, because it's a little bit weird. 

**Erica:** Yeah, these will help you understand the meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: So, I reinforced all the walls; there's no way they're gonna fall down. 

**Example Two** 

> B: This plastic is reinforced with the glass, so it's both light and strong. 

**Marco:** So, basically, anything that's reinforced is made stronger. 

**Erica:** Perfect. 

**Marco:** Reinforced steel… 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Reinforced table. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Anything. Okay. Great, so now we could listen to our dialogue again. You can practice all these words that we just talked about and we'll come back shortly. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

> A: Hi there, can I help you folks?

> B: I'm just browsing; seeing what's on the lot. My daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know how it is.

> C: Dad! I'm sixteen already and I'm, like, the only one at school who doesn't have a car!

> A: She is right, you know. Kids these days all have cars. Let me show you something we just got in: a 1996 sedan. Excellent gas mileage, it has dual airbags and anti lock brakes; a perfect vehicle for a young driver.

> C: Dad, I love it! It's awesome! Can we get this one please?

> B: I see… What can you tell me about this one?

> A: Oh, that's just an old World War Two tank that we use for TV commercials. Now about this sedan…

> B: Whoa, whoa wait a minute. Tell me more about this tank.

> A: Well, Sir, if you are looking for quality and safety then look no further! Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short range missile attacks.

> B: Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

> A: It does not.

> B: Well, I don't know. Let me sleep on it.

> A: Did I mention the tank is a tank?

> B: I'll take it!

> C: Dad!

**Erica:** So, we have a couple of interesting phrases to talk about shopping. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Let's look at these in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** The first one is I'm just browsing. 

**Erica:** I'm just browsing. 

**Marco:** I'm just browsing. 

**Erica:** I'm just browsing. 

**Marco:** This is a really useful phrase, because usually salespeople will come up to you and ask you "can I help you?" or… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** "Are you interested in something?" 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And you're just looking, so… 

**Erica:** Yeah, you maybe… you don't really wanna buy today. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, you're just "uh, I'm just browsing". 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, then they'll just leave you alone and… 

**Erica:** Yeah, they won't bother you as much. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's a good, good phrase. 

**Erica:** Another good phrase. 

**Marco:** Sleep on it. 

**Erica:** Sleep on it. 

**Marco:** Sleep on it. 

**Erica:** Sleep on it. 

**Marco:** So, we have some examples of how we use sleep on it. 

**Example One** 

> A: I don't know if we should buy that house. It's perfect for us, but it's so expensive. 

> B: Let's sleep on it. 

**Example Two** 

> C: Why don't you sleep on it and tell me tomorrow? 

**Example Three** 

> D: This is a bit more than what I can afford; let me sleep on it. 

**Marco:** To sleep on it means to… 

**Erica:** Like to think about it overnight. 

**Marco:** To think about it, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, maybe you wanna buy this really expensive car. 

**Erica:** But you need to think about it. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So, you'll sleep on it. 

**Marco:** So… yeah. You go home, sleep on it, think about it twice and then make a decision. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, great words and great dialogue, so… 

**Erica:** Yeah, I love this dialogue. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it was… it's kind of funny. So, we could listen to it again and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about it. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

> A: Hi there, can I help you folks?

> B: I'm just browsing; seeing what's on the lot. My daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know how it is.

> C: Dad! I'm sixteen already and I'm, like, the only one at school who doesn't have a car!

> A: She is right, you know. Kids these days all have cars. Let me show you something we just got in: a 1996 sedan. Excellent gas mileage, it has dual airbags and anti lock brakes; a perfect vehicle for a young driver.

> C: Dad, I love it! It's awesome! Can we get this one please?

> B: I see… What can you tell me about this one?

> A: Oh, that's just an old World War Two tank that we use for TV commercials. Now about this sedan…

> B: Whoa, whoa wait a minute. Tell me more about this tank.

> A: Well, Sir, if you are looking for quality and safety then look no further! Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short range missile attacks.

> B: Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

> A: It does not.

> B: Well, I don't know. Let me sleep on it.

> A: Did I mention the tank is a tank?

> B: I'll take it!

> C: Dad!

**Erica:** So, Marco, have you ever driven a tank? 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well… 

**Erica:** I… I mean know you were in the army, so… 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, actually I did… I did drive, uh, a tank before. 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** A really… yeah, a really old one… 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** Kind of like a World War Two type tank. But, yeah, they're really fun and interesting. You have… it's not like driving a normal car. You have pedals and you have… 

**Erica:** So, there's no steering wheel? 

**Marco:** No, no, no. You have, um, levers… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And, uh… what many people don't know is that actually tanks are… manual transmission, so you have to change gears. 

**Erica:** Oh, really? 

**Marco:** And it's really hard to change gears on those things. 

**Erica:** And what's the gas mileage like on a tank? 

**Marco:** Hehe. I don't know, maybe like five miles per gallon, well… 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** They run on diesel… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Witch is a different type of fuel, right? 

**Erica:** Yep. Okay, well, very cool. I never knew that my podcast partner had driven a tank. That's pretty awesome. 

**Marco:** Yeah, well, it was… it was fun, definitely and… I hope I get to do it again some day. 

**Erica:** Alright. Well, uh, guys, have you ever driven a tank? 

**Marco:** Or a submarine or any type of, uh, armor vehicle. 

**Erica:** Yeah, tell us about it at our website englishpod.com. 

**Marco:** Right, we'll be there to answer all your questions. I'll also be there to maybe post some more crazy stories. 

**Erica:** Or some pictures of the tank or something. 

**Marco:** Yeah, maybe. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright guys, we'll see you there… until then it's… 

**Erica:** Good bye! 

**Marco:** Bye!
