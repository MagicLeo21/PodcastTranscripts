## What am I thinking

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** Today we're bringing you an upper intermediate lesson and something that we all do. 

**Erica:** Right, talking to ourselves. 

**Marco:** Talking to ourselves, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I think everyone does it. You think to yourself or you talk to yourself. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And we're gonna be doing that today, but we're gonna be looking at some specific vocabulary. Erica, why don't you tell us about that? 

**Erica:** Well, unfortunately, we're gonna be following a guy as he's in a really embarrassing situation and we're gonna hear him call himself some bad names. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** In his mind. 

**Marco:** So, he's a little bit nervous and he thinks he is, uh, not very smart, right? 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, before we start with this dialogue, there're a couple of words that we should look at in "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Alright, we're gonna hear both of these words in the dialogue and the first one is famished. 

**Marco:** Famished. 

**Erica:** Famished. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, famished is an adjective. 

**Erica:** That's right, meaning very, very, very hungry. 

**Marco:** Very, very hungry, okay. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, just very hungry… very easy. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Famished. 

**Erica:** Now, what about our next one? Sexist. [NOTE: please, be careful, and don't confuse this word with the sexiest. For example, she was the sexiest girl I'd ever seen] 

**Marco:** Sexist. 

**Erica:** Sexist. 

**Marco:** Another adjective to describe a person, right? 

**Erica:** Right. Or a thing, I guess… so, yeah, an idea. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, a sexist person would be… 

**Erica:** Somebody, who judges people by their sex. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, like all women are stupid, for example. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Which is not true, of course. 

**Erica:** No, of course not. 

**Marco:** Right? So sexist works both ways… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** A women can be sexist, a man could be sexist. 

**Erica:** Exactly. Um, meaning the woman thinks all men are stupid. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Which is also not true. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Let's just be clear about that. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, so, now, that we've taken a look at these two phrases, let's stat with our dialogue and we'll be back to talk about all the great words. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, embarrassing first date, ha? 

**Erica:** Yeah, I mean I really do feel sorry for this guy. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, it happens to us. Sometimes we are in the company of a very beautiful girl and we just get really nervous. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, I mean, though, psychologist call this negative self talk. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Oh, really? 

**Erica:** Yeah, this sort of calling yourself names and talking negatively about yourself, but… actually, you can use some of this language to talk negatively about… 

**Marco:** Others. Hehe. 

**Erica:** Yeah. So, why don't we look now at this language in "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** So, in language takeaway today we have five words. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Let's start with our first one. 

**Erica:** Dumb ass. 

**Marco:** Dumb ass. 

**Erica:** Dumb ass. 

**Marco:** Okay, now this is an… a very, uh, "polite" word, I would say. 

**Erica:** Definitely, not polite. 

**Marco:** Okay, but… what is a dumb ass? 

**Erica:** Well, um, it's obviously a dumb stupid idiot. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, so, it's a person, that is not very intelligent. 

**Erica:** And our next word is also quite similar. 

**Marco:** Moron. 

**Erica:** Moron. 

**Marco:** Moron. 

**Erica:** A moron. 

**Marco:** If a person is a dumb ass or a person is a moron… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** What's the difference? 

**Erica:** Um, well, basically, a moron is someone who is… not smart, who is very unintelligent. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, they don't know what one plus one is. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Alright? But a dumb ass is a person, who does stupid things. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, maybe a dumb ass like you're planning a bank robbery and the dumb ass forgets to bring the gun. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay. That is a dumb ass, alright. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, maybe a moron is a little bit less offensive… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And it's actually… you'll find it in a dictionary, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Whereas a dumb ass… I don't think… 

**Erica:** It's… 

**Marco:** You'll find it. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's slang. 

**Marco:** It's slang. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Now, what about this next…? It's also a negative name you can call people – a tool. 

**Marco:** Tool. 

**Erica:** Tool. 

**Marco:** This is very strange, because I don't know how a tool can be something negative. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Towards a person. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But it actually means the opposite, right? If a person is called a tool, it means they are… 

**Erica:** Useless. 

**Marco:** Useless, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, if you've ever called a tool, they're saying that you're useless. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** You're good for nothing. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, these are three interesting words. So, why don't we hear some examples of each of these words in use? 

**Example One** 

> A: I hate Tom! He's such a dumb ass! Last week he borrowed my mobile phone and dropped it in to the pool! 

**Example Two** 

> B: I don't like Kevin very much. He can be a real moron at times. 

**Example Three** 

> C: He was looking for a job, but he didn't even have a resume prepared. He's such a tool. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, great examples and here at EnglishPod we're bringing you real street talk. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Language as it has spoken by today's youth. 

**Marco:** Okay, now let's take a look at our last two words. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, these phrases you can use when you're trying to calm yourself down and make yourself relax a little bit, right? 

**Marco:** Right, let's take a look at the next one – chill. 

**Erica:** Chill. 

**Marco:** Okay, chill. 

**Erica:** Chill. 

**Marco:** So, again, relax… 

**Erica:** Calm down. 

**Marco:** Calm down. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** You need to chill. 

**Erica:** Yes. And then you also need to be cool. 

**Marco:** Be cool. 

**Erica:** Be cool. 

**Marco:** Now, if you can tell the patterns related to temperature, right… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Chill is cold. Cool is similar to cold. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, again, that's what it means, to relax. 

**Erica:** To calm down your emotions. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Make your emotions not so hot. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, chill, be cool. 

**Erica:** Exactly. And you use them together like that, don't you? 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Now chill also has another… another way of using it, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** You can say "I'm chilling with my friends". 

**Erica:** Yeah, "we're chilling here in the EnglishPod studio". 

**Marco:** Hehe. Which means, we're just relaxing… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** We're just, uh, having fun. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Not doing anything, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly, but you can't say chillinG, you have to… you have to drop the G. 

**Marco:** Yeah, you have to drop… Hehe. Right, you can't say I'm chillinG. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** You have to say I'm chillin'. 

**Erica:** I'm chillin'. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, so, that's all for language takeaway, but now let's take a look at some of the really useful phrases, that we saw in this dialogue in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** Okay, so, this guy is so happy he's on this date, that he wants to scream at the top of his lungs. 

**Marco:** Scream at the top of my lungs. 

**Erica:** Scream at the top of my lungs. 

**Marco:** So, basically, he just wants to… like scream. 

**Erica:** To shout really loudly. [NOTE: shout = scream] 

**Marco:** Really loudly. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** He's so excited, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, for example, sometimes you're at a concert, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And you need to talk to your friend and you like screaming at the top of your lungs, because the other person can't hear you. 

**Erica:** Exactly. Or maybe you're lost in the woods and you need to scream at the top of your lungs, so that someone will hear you… 

**Marco:** Hey. 

**Erica:** And find you. 

**Marco:** Alright, very good. Okay, so, scream at the top of my lungs. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Our next phrase. 

**Erica:** Get it together. 

**Marco:** Get it together. 

**Erica:** Get it together. 

**Marco:** So, if I tell you "Erica, you need to get it together"… 

**Erica:** Basically, you're telling me to calm down, relax. 

**Marco:** So, pull your emotions together… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** You know, get your ideas straight. 

**Erica:** Right, so, i… i… it kind of gives you this idea, that you gotta… pull, like you said… pull your emotions together in a little box and tie them up. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, so, get it together. 

**Erica:** Yeah. So, Marco, when would you use this phrase get it together? 

**Marco:** I guess, when somebody is either very emotional, maybe crying… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or very nervous… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** You know, you tell a person "oh, get… get it together", you know… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Relax. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or when somebody maybe is not doing something good in their life… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** You know, like making bad decisions… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or not being responsible, you'd… you'd tell that person "you need to get it together". 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Exactly! I couldn't have said it better myself. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, so now, why don't we move on to our next phrase? And this is really, really high frequency… I think… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** You would hear it all the time. 

**Erica:** Alright, so, what the hell. 

**Marco:** What the hell. 

**Erica:** What the hell. 

**Marco:** So, why would you say "what the hell"? 

**Erica:** Well, obviously, you're asking a question, right? 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Cause you got your… your W… you got your what. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** But when you say "the hell", you're putting emphasis on the what. 

**Marco:** So, you're asking a really strong question. 

**Erica:** Right, but it's not polite. 

**Marco:** It's not polite. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, if I say "what the hell is going on"? 

**Erica:** Um… 

**Marco:** What's happening? 

**Erica:** Really, really what's happening. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, and we can change it a little bit. We can replace the what with another WH, like… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Why. 

**Erica:** How. 

**Marco:** How. 

**Erica:** Where. 

**Marco:** Where or when. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, why don't we hear some examples of how this expression is used… using different WH-words? 

**Example One** 

> A: Where the hell are you? I've been waiting for hours! [NOTE: or maybe four hours?] 

**Example Two** 

> B: How the hell did you do that? That was amazing! 

**Example Three** 

> C: When the hell are you going to find a job? I'm tired of paying for everything. [NOTE: I guess, you could also say "I'm tired of pay for…"] 

**Example Four**

> D: Who the hell are you? I don't know you? 

**Erica:** Alright, now our final word, also a little bit strong, um, but… pretty high frequency. 

**Marco:** Oh, yeah, very high frequency. 

**Erica:** Oh, crap. 

**Marco:** Oh, crap. 

**Erica:** Oh, crap. 

**Marco:** So… it's a little bit strong, but less strong than maybe saying a really bad word, right? 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** But, it's definitely saying… like you made a mistake, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah… 

**Marco:** And… 

**Erica:** It's like a really strong "oh, no". 

**Marco:** "Oh, no", exactly, a really strong "on, no". 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But, I guess, not many people say "oh, no!" ??? 

**Erica:** Yeah. "Oh, no! I just lost ten million dollars". 

**Marco:** Exactly, right? You would not say that. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, it's a very strong "oh, no", but it's not as strong as it could be. 

**Erica:** There're other words out there, that are stronger, but we're not gonna go into them here. 

**Marco:** But maybe you guys know, so let us know. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Well, we can definitely keep an eye out on the… comment section 

**Erica:** But… don't write the words on the comment section. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, so, we saw some really great phrases, some really great words, a lot of informal language, but it's very high frequency and you'll use that with you friends or you'll see it in movies, TV shows… 

**Erica:** Yeah, really common in movies and in TV shows. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so let's listen to this dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** 

**Marco:** So, this… these slang words, they're actually very common, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, I think like you said, you… it's not likely that you'll find them in a dictionary, um… 

**Marco:** Of course. And you can find them in movies or sometimes, when you're having a conversation and a very informal conversation with a native speaker… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** These words will slip out and these, uh, slang terms will come up. 

**Erica:** Exactly. And, you know, there's a great resource out there for wonderful English slang terms called UrbanDictionary.com. 

**Marco:** Exactly, if you ever see a word, that maybe you can't find in conventional dictionary, you're probably gonna find it there. 

**Erica:** Yeah, we'll put the link up to it on the site. 

**Marco:** Alright, so also, if you have any questions and comments, be sure to come to our website englishpod.com. 

**Erica:** Marco and I are there to, um, answer all your questions and we've also got lots of resources like links to Urban Dictionary.
