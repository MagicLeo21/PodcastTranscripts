## I'm In Debt

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! And welcome to another great podcast with EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we have another really great lesson for you – elementary lesson. 

**Erica:** That's right and that's another lesson about money. 

**Marco:** We have no money here at EnglishPod, we are in debt here. 

**Erica:** In debt! 

**Marco:** Yes. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** In dept. 

**Erica:** In debt. 

**Marco:** So, what does that mean? Why don't you tell us? 

**Erica:** If I owe you money, I'm in debt. 

**Marco:** In debt, yes. 

**Erica:** In fact, I think I am in debt to you. 

**Marco:** Hehe. You owe me two fifty (2,50) for a coke zero today. 

**Erica:** That's true. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright. Okay, so, let's get started; let's take a look at our "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** We have two words today in our vocabulary preview and the first one is recession. 

**Marco:** Recession. 

**Erica:** Recession. 

**Marco:** Recession. 

**Erica:** So, recession. Everyone's talking about it right now and what does it mean? 

**Marco:** I don't know. 

**Erica:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** Hehe. That's your topic. I don't know. I really don't know, why don't you tell me, Erica, cause this isn't my topic for today? 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Recession is a period of time when the economy of a country is doing badly. 

**Marco:** In a recession the country is making less money. 

**Erica:** That's true, so, maybe we can give a few examples of things that happen in a recession to show the meaning of this a little bit better. 

**Marco:** Right, so, for example, in a recession many people lose their jobs. 

**Erica:** Because, uh, companies might close or go bankrupt. 

**Marco:** Exactly, and also people start spending less money. 

**Erica:** That's true, and the stock prices of companies, um, fall pretty dra… 

**Marco:** ??? fall. 

**Erica:** Yeah, they… they fall a lot, hey? 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah, and that's what's going on now in the United States. 

**Erica:** Very true. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, let's take a look at our second word and it has to do with recession, it's broke. 

**Erica:** Broke. 

**Marco:** Broke. 

**Erica:** I'm broke. 

**Marco:** Broke, it means that you have no money, you're broke. 

**Erica:** I'm broke. 

**Marco:** Right, so, these are our two words for vocabulary preview today and you're going to hear them in the dialogue. 

**Erica:** This dialogue is about a man who is in debt, he's broke. Let's find out what happens. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that was a bit unexpected. 

**Erica:** Yeah, that was certainly strange. He didn't go to the bank to ask for money, did he? 

**Marco:** No, he went to the mob. 

**Erica:** O… 

**Marco:** And the mob is broke 

**Erica:** Oh, no! You know it's a bad recession when even the mob runs out of money. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, so, why don't we start by looking at our "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, so, for today's language takeaway we have four words from the dialogue, which we think are really important. 

**Marco:** Yes, so, why don't we start with the first one? Loan. 

**Erica:** Loan. 

**Marco:** Loan. 

**Erica:** Loan. 

**Marco:** So, Erica, tell us about a loan? What is a loan? 

**Erica:** Okay, when you borrow money, you get a loan. 

**Marco:** A loan, yes. Not to be confused with alone, like by myself. Hehe. 

**Erica:** No, so, this is L-O-A-N. 

**Marco:** Loan. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** Okay, great. Let's take a look at our second word – mortgage. 

**Erica:** Mortgage. 

**Marco:** Mortgage. 

**Erica:** Mortgage. 

**Marco:** Now, this is very common. I'm sure many of you have mortgages. What is a mortgage? 

**Erica:** A mortgage is a type of a loan. Basically, it's a loan that helps you to buy a house. 

**Marco:** A house or property. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, this is a funny word. I mean there's the strange mortgage with a T. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it has a T in it, but you don't pronounce it, you say mor[t]gage, mor[t]gage. 

**Erica:** So, not mort… morTgage. 

**Marco:** Not, morTgage. 

**Erica:** Mor[t]gage. 

**Marco:** Mor[t]gage, yeah. I had trouble spelling that one for this lesson, so, I learned it well now. 

**Erica:** Okay. Let's move to our third word today. 

**Marco:** Hit me pretty hard. 

**Erica:** Hit me pretty hard. 

**Marco:** Hit me pretty hard. 

**Erica:** Hit me pretty hard. I think we have some examples that will help us understand this phrase. 

**Example One** 

> A: My divorce hit me pretty hard. I'm so depressed. 

**Example Two** 

> B: This cold has hit me pretty hard. I've been in bed for a week. 

**Example Three** 

> C: The news of Fluffy's death hit me pretty hard. I've been crying for days. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that's a lot clear. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Great. Why don't we take a look at our last word for language takeaway? 

**Erica:** Tuition. 

**Marco:** Tuition. 

**Erica:** Tuition. 

**Marco:** Tuition. 

**Erica:** So, this is the money you have to pay to your school, so, that you can study there. 

**Marco:** Right, um, usually it's in college, right, or university? 

**Erica:** Yeah, but sometimes in some countries you have to pay tuition for public school. 

**Marco:** Okay, great, so, it's time to listen to our dialogue again and it's gonna be slower, so we can listen to all the words that we just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Okay, so, I think a lot of the key language we just talked about is a lot more clear now, but you know, I also noticed some really interesting phrases in this dialogue. 

**Marco:** Yes, I did too, so, let's start with "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** "Fluency builder" is a tool that we use to help you sound more native. 

**Marco:** Right, so, you can sound more natural when you're speaking. 

**Erica:** So, we take a really common phrase and we show you some great natural ways of expressing that same idea. 

**Marco:** Exactly, and today we have three of these examples. Let's start with the first one. 

**Erica:** So, this phrase we use when we want to ask somebody "Can I help you?" 

> Phrase 1: What can I do for you? What can I do for you? 

**Erica:** Yeah, that sounds really, really polite and really natural. 

**Marco:** Right, so, instead of saying "Can I help you" or… I don't know, "What do you need", we can just say what can I do for you. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Great. 

**Erica:** So, let's move to our second phrase. This phrase we use when we need something, when we wanna say "I'm sorry to bother you". 

**Marco:** Or "I'm sorry to interrupt". 

**Erica:** Okay, let's listen. 

> Phrase 2: I'm really sorry to trouble you. I'm really sorry to trouble you. 

**Erica:** I'm sorry to trouble you. This phrase might be a little bit more difficult to understand how it's used, um, but we"ve got some examples. 

**Marco:** Yes, so, let's listen. 

**Example One** 

> A: Can I trouble you for a moment? I just need you to sign this form for me. 

**Example Two** 

> B: I'm sorry to trouble you, but may I go home early today? 

**Example Three** 

> C: Can I trouble you for a pen? Mine is not working anymore. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, now let's take a look at our last phrase for fluency builder – on top of all that. 

**Erica:** On top of all that. 

**Marco:** On top of all that. 

**Erica:** This is a really useful phrase. Marco, how would you use it? 

**Marco:** Well, for example, today I lost my job… 

**Erica:** Oh, no. 

**Marco:** My car got stolen. 

**Erica:** Oh, my God. 

**Marco:** And on top of all that my girlfriend broke up with me. 

**Erica:** That was a terrible day. 

**Marco:** It was, but don't worry, you can use this phrase also in a positive way. 

**Erica:** That's true, you could say "So, today was a really great day! It was my birthday and all my friends came to visit me and on top of all that I got a million presents". 

**Marco:** Hehe. That is a great day, so, you can use on top of all that in this way. 

**Erica:** It's like "and also". 

**Marco:** And also, yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, on top of all that. 

**Marco:** So, we are ready to listen to our dialogue a third time. We can hear all the words that we just talked about and all the phrases and you'll definitely be able to understand a lot better now. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Erica:** Today's dialogue was all about being in debt, right? 

**Marco:** Yes. 

**Erica:** And… and different people have different attitudes or different viewpoints on being in debt. 

**Marco:** Yes, that's true, for example, in North America and in Canada it's a really common thing. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's actually almost good to be in debt. 

**Marco:** It's more than good, it's necessary to be in debt. 

**Erica:** That's right, unless you have… a history of being in debt and regularly paying off your debts, you can't actually borrow money, you can't get a mortgage, you can't get a… a car loan, so you can buy a new car. 

**Marco:** Right, that's called a credit history, so, you must have a good credit history in order to be able to, like you say, buy a car or buy a house. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and you know the funny thing is, um, when I was in university, maybe I was eighteen years old, the first thing that happened at university was, you know, banks came to our university and started offering you credit cards, so, you can get a credit card when you're eighteen no problem. 

**Marco:** And not only do they offer you credit cards, they give you like free gifts if you sign up for a credit card. 

**Erica:** I know they really want you to have a credit card. 

**Marco:** Of course they want you to spend more money, that's the trick. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but you know what, it's totally different in Europe, for example, I used to live in Switzerland and there they're really careful with debts like it's a bad thing to be in debt. 

**Marco:** Oh, yeah, I mean it's bad to be in debt, definitely. 

**Erica:** For example, if I wanna have a credit card in Switzerland and let's say I want to have a limit of, um, five hundred (500) francs that I can spend every month, I need to put in my bank account seven hundred (700) francs before I can even spend that credit card money, so, it's totally opposite from North America. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, yeah, I mean in North America it's crazy the way that people are in debt and it's showing now with the recession, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, that's true. 

**Marco:** So, everyone, be sure to handle your money carefully, don't be in debt unless you really, really have to.
