## Movie Trailer

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're going back to the movies. 

**Erica:** That's right, we've got a great lesson today and I'm really excited about this dialogue. I think it's fantastic. 

**Marco:** Hehe. We have an original EnglishPod production of a movie trailer. 

**Erica:** So, what is a movie trailer? 

**Marco:** Well, whenever you go to the cinema… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Um, before the movie starts you have previews of upcoming movies. 

**Erica:** So, like almost an advertisement for a future movie. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, that's a movie trailer and that's what we're bringing you today. 

**Erica:** A lot of great language you'll commonly hear in action movies. 

**Marco:** Right, so, let's start with "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** We have one word today – possess. 

**Marco:** Possess. 

**Erica:** Possess. 

**Marco:** Possess. 

**Erica:** So, when you possess something, you… 

**Marco:** Have it. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** It's in your possession. You… 

**Erica:** Simple. 

**Marco:** You have it, right? 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** So, in this dialogue our actors possess something very important. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and it's going to be a little bit fast and a little bit difficult to understand. 

**Erica:** But don't worry, we'll come back and explain all of the key language later. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Wow, so, it sounds like a really good movie. 

**Erica:** I know. When is it coming out? 

**Marco:** Uh, I think in two thousand fifteen (2015). 

**Erica:** Okay, I'll put that in my calendar. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, let's take a look at the vocabulary we saw in this dialogue in language takeaway. 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** In language takeaway today we have three words. What's our first one? 

**Erica:** Survival. 

**Marco:** Survival. 

**Erica:** Survival. 

**Marco:** Survival. 

**Erica:** Well, survival is continuing to live even in really hard times. 

**Marco:** It comes from the verb to survive. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Right? So, survival is the noun form. 

**Erica:** Right, so… so maybe you are lost in… in… 

**Marco:** The jungle. 

**Erica:** The jungle and you have to fight for survival. 

**Marco:** Right, you have to try to survive. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Okay, our next word – defend. 

**Erica:** Defend. 

**Marco:** Defend. 

**Erica:** Defend. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to some examples of defend, so you can understand the meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: We have to defend the castle. The army is trying to kill the king! 

**Example Two** 

> B: The soldiers defended the base in the difficult battle. 

**Example Three** 

> C: These new machine guns will defend us. 

**Marco:** So, basically, it's to protect, right? 

**Erica:** Right, to protect from something that is really harmful. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you would defend your children. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** You would defend your… 

**Erica:** Your house. 

**Marco:** Your house. 

**Erica:** Or your castle. 

**Marco:** Your dog, your cat. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. And our last word on language takeaway – rough. 

**Erica:** Rough. 

**Marco:** Rough. 

**Erica:** R-O-U-G-H. Rough. 

**Marco:** Right, it's got that "ugh"… 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Sound. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** So, it basically means… so when something is rough, it's a little bit violent… 

**Erica:** And hard… 

**Marco:** Hard. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** For example, boxing is a rough sport. 

**Erica:** Or hockey is also a rough sport. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, you have rough sports or maybe even a person can be a little bit rough. 

**Erica:** Yes. Or that person can play rough. 

**Marco:** Play rough, exactly. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, rough. Okay, so, we're ready to listen to our dialogue again. 

**Erica:** And this time it'll be a little bit slower, so, you can understand the language a little bit more clearly. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** So, we saw some interesting phrases in this dialogue. Let's take a look at them in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** The first phrase that we saw – at all costs. 

**Erica:** At all costs. 

**Marco:** At all costs. 

**Erica:** At all costs. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to some examples before we explain "at all costs". 

**Example One** 

> A: I'll protect my kids at all costs. 

**Example Two** 

> B: We have to get this project done at all costs. 

**Example Three** 

> C: You find those criminals at all costs. 

**Erica:** Well, if you're going to protect your kids at all costs, you're going to protect them even if it's a really hard. 

**Marco:** Right, it doesn't matter how hard it is or what you have to do. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** You'll do it. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** At all costs. Now we have, um… now let's take a look at our second phrase for fluency builder and it's very similar to at all costs. 

**Erica:** Yeah, really similar. 

**Marco:** No matter what. 

**Erica:** No matter what. 

**Marco:** No matter what. 

**Erica:** No matter what. 

**Marco:** For example, I'm going to go on vacation no matter what my boss says. 

**Erica:** Nothing's gonna stop you. 

**Marco:** Right, if he says no, I'm still going on my vacation. 

**Erica:** And I'm gonna protect my kids no matter what. 

**Marco:** Exactly, no matter what. 

**Erica:** I don't have kids, though. 

**Marco:** Hehe. But you will protect them no matter what. 

**Erica:** If I had them. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay. Uh, and our last phrase – stand in their way. 

**Erica:** Stand in their way. 

**Marco:** Stand in their way. 

**Erica:** Stand in their way. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to some examples of "stand in someone's way". 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And then we'll come back and explain it. 

**Example One** 

> A: Don't let anything stand in the way of your goals. 

**Example Two** 

> B: I'm going to find that guy and nothing is going to stand in my way. 

**Example Three** 

> C: I don't care what happens. I'm gonna get that money and you'd better not stand in my way. 

**Marco:** So, when something stands in your way, it's… 

**Erica:** It's preventing you from reaching your goal. 

**Marco:** From reaching your goal, right? Or we can also have somebody standing in your way physically. 

**Erica:** Like really you're standing close to me and I can't pass through the door. 

**Marco:** Right, right. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, maybe that person is at the door and… is standing in my way. I can't go in. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** But here we're not really talking about a real thing, right? That you can touch. 

**Marco:** Right, it's more of some obstacle that's preventing you from reaching you goals or from doing what you want to do. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** So, now we can listen to our dialogue again and now you can understand these words that we've just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Erica:** I know that you're a big movie fan, right? 

**Marco:** Yeah, I'm a big movie fan I usually watch maybe three or five movies a week. 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** Yeah-yeah. 

**Erica:** Wow! Many students of English like to watch movies as a way to improve their English. 

**Marco:** That's one of the best ways to learn English… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** As through songs and movies. 

**Erica:** What do you think of some useful movies that people can watch to practice English? 

**Marco:** Well, I would recommend children's movies. 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** Yeah, they have simple vocabulary, but they have very common language. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And also what's happening in the movie is very easy to understand and to follow. 

**Erica:** So. You can see the action and then hear the word. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, if you like to watch movies, rent a DVD or go buy a DVD, watch it in the original language… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** With English subtitles. 

**Erica:** So, you should watch it in English. 

**Marco:** With English subtitles. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and what is subtitles? 

**Marco:** Subtitles are the words that you see at the bottom of the screen that translate… 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** What the people are saying. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Yeah, that's the best thing to do. Try that exercise. If you have a pen and paper with you, it's much better. You can pause the movie, write down the word you don't understand and then maybe review it later. 

**Erica:** That's a really good tip. I always tell my students that they should watch movies, listen to music, read the newspaper and write down at least five new words or phrases a week. 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** It's a really good exercising, you'll improve a lot. 

**Erica:** Yes. So, everyone, we want you to go and watch a movie in English. Turn on the subtitles and write down some new vocabulary. 

**Marco:** Exactly. And if you have any comments or questions or maybe even suggestions, you can come to our website at englishpod.com and leave them in our community page. 

**Erica:** Yeah, Marco and I are always around to help you and we love to hear about what you're learning and what movies you're watching. 

**Marco:** Exactly. So, we're out of time today. We'll see you guys next time. Until then it's… 

**Erica:** Good bye. 

**Marco:** Bye.
