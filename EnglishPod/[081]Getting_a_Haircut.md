## Getting a Haircut

---

**Marco:** Hello everyone! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're gonna be going to one of those places that is really common, right? 

**Erica:** That's right. We're going to the hair salon. 

**Marco:** The hair salon or maybe also called a barbershop. 

**Erica:** I guess in this case it's a barber shop, because, uh, it's a man who's getting his haircut. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, before we see what happens in this barbershop, let's take a look at some of the vocabulary we might encounter in "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Okay, we're gonna look at two words that you'll hear in this dialogue and the first one is trim. 

**Marco:** Trim. 

**Erica:** A trim. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, when you trim something… 

**Erica:** You cut just a little bit of it. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, if I go to the hair salon to get a trim… 

**Erica:** You are going to cut only a little bit of your hair. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** You're not gonna change the style and make it look different. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, a trim. 

**Erica:** Uhu. And I think here we've seen that i… i… it could be a verb and a noun, right? 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I'm going to get a trim. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Or I want you to trim my hair. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** Alright. And what about our next word? 

**Erica:** Fancy. 

**Marco:** Fancy. 

**Erica:** Fancy. 

**Marco:** So, fancy, now, we know that this word maybe is related to something like luxury. 

**Erica:** Or formal or something like that. 

**Marco:** Right, but in this case or in this context we're gonna be using it a little bit different. 

**Erica:** That's right. Here, in this dialogue we'll hear "nothing too fancy". 

**Marco:** Or nothing too complicated. 

**Erica:** Nothing too different. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, we don't want anything too fancy. 

**Erica:** Alright, but with these two words in mind I think we're ready to listen to the dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I think maybe his hair cut is not quite what he expected. 

**Erica:** I think he trusted this stylist a little bit too much. 

**Marco:** Hehe. I think this stylist had too many Red Bulls or something. 

**Erica:** Maybe. 

**Marco:** He was very hyper. 

**Erica:** Maybe that was this problem. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, why don't we take a look now at some of the language that we saw in "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** So, I guess this stylist really thought this guy had nice hair, right? 

**Marco:** Yeah, we heard how he described his hair. 

**Erica:** He said it was so silky. 

**Marco:** Silky. 

**Erica:** Silky. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, we know the word – silk. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** A material, very soft and smooth material. 

**Erica:** Yeah. And when something is silky, um, it's very soft and smooth. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, silky hair. 

**Erica:** Or silky skin. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, silky. So, he said he had silky and shiny hair. 

**Erica:** Shiny. 

**Marco:** Shiny. 

**Erica:** Shiny. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, we know what shiny is. 

**Erica:** Do we? 

**Marco:** Yes, we do. 

**Erica:** Okay, what? 

**Marco:** Hehe. So, something that is shiny is… you can see yourself in it; like gold is shiny. 

**Erica:** Or silver is shiny. 

**Marco:** Alright, or if you look in the back of a CD… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** It's shiny. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, the light bounces of things that are shiny. 

**Marco:** Alright. Now, getting into more hair style vocabulary, he wanted to make sure that his sideburns were even. 

**Erica:** Sideburns. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, sideburns. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, sideburns are things that men have, right? 

**Marco:** Alright, women don't have sideburns. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, it's kind of like a beard. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And it's the hair that grows on your cheeks near your ears. 

**Marco:** Okay, those are your sideburns. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And now, also the hairstylist suggested that he should let his hair grow out. 

**Erica:** Grow out. 

**Marco:** Grow out. 

**Erica:** Let your hair grow out. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, what does that mean exactly? 

**Erica:** Make… let your hair get longer. 

**Marco:** So, you can say "let you hair grow". 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But I guess it's more common to hear "let your hair grow out". 

**Erica:** Well, maybe it just means something a little bit different… 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** If I let my hair grow, I might let it grow a little bit… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Might grow it a little bit longer, but if I let my hair grow out maybe it's short now and I'll let it get really long. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, to… let your hair grow out is to really change the length. 

**Marco:** Alright. Very good, so, let your hair grow out. And our last word on language takeaway today – afro. 

**Erica:** Afro. 

**Marco:** Afro. 

**Erica:** So, if this guy let his curly hair grow out, he would have an afro. 

**Marco:** An afro, right? 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, now this hairstyle was very popular in the Seventies. 

**Erica:** That's right. It's like a big round curly fluffy ball of hair. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, that's an afro. 

**Erica:** We'll post some pictures on the web… just like for you to get a clear idea what this looks like. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, I think now we are ready to listen to our dialogue for the second time an then we'll come back and look at some phrases. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Okay, so, we have some phrases here, um, that you might hear in a hair salon or in a barbershop. So, why don't we look at those now in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** The hairstylist said don't just stand there. 

**Erica:** Don't just stand there. 

**Marco:** Alright, don't just stand there. 

**Erica:** So, this is and interesting phrase, Marco, I mean it's made up of really simple words, right? 

**Marco:** Right, but actually those words make it an order that's a little bit different. 

**Erica:** So, why don't we hear few examples to help us understand how to use this phrase? 

**Example One** 

> A: Don't just stand there. Help me take these boxes into the house. 

**Example Two** 

> B: The house is on fire! Don't just stand there! Call the fire department! 

**Example Three** 

> C: Don't just stand there in the rain. Come inside. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, basically we can understand that if somebody tells you "don't just stand there", they are expecting you to do something. 

**Erica:** We might use this phrase, uh, when somebody is not doing what we think they should do. 

**Marco:** Okay. When action is required. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, why don't we move on to our next phrase now? 

**Erica:** Look like a million bucks. 

**Marco:** You look like a million bucks. 

**Erica:** So, when someone looks like a million bucks, they look… 

**Marco:** Really, really good. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, that is a very common way of just saying you look very good. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Or something looks like a million bucks. 

**Erica:** So, it can be for a person or a thing, right? 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Okay, and our final phrase. And this one is really common in… in barbershops - take a little off the top. 

**Marco:** Take a little off the top. 

**Erica:** Take a little off the top. 

**Marco:** So, that basically means cut a little bit on top. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** And now, can I say "take a little off the sides"? 

**Erica:** Yeah, you can say that as well. 

**Marco:** Alright. So, take a little off the top; take a little off the sides. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, with all this great haircutting language, why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time? 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, now talking about hairstyles and different, uh, types of hair, there're some interesting ones and maybe aren't so fashionable anymore, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, um, actually English has a lot of really cool words to describe haircuts. 

**Marco:** So, let's start with the couple of them. For example, a mullet. 

**Erica:** A mullet, so, this is when your hair is really short on top and really long in the back. 

**Marco:** Right, so, the sides and the top are really short, but in the back you have long hair. 

**Erica:** Yeah, um, in Canada we call that a shorty-shorty-longback. 

**Marco:** Shorty-shorty-longback. 

**Erica:** Yeah. We also call it hockey hair. 

**Marco:** Hockey hair. 

**Erica:** Or even all business up front / all party behind. 

**Marco:** Oh, Canadians are, uh, obviously very into this hairstyle. 

**Erica:** It's unfortunately true. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, we also have for example, a mohawk. 

**Erica:** Hm, popular amongst the punk rock kids. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, you shave your head on the sides… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But you leave a little like stripe of… 

**Erica:** Ye… 

**Marco:** Long hair on top. 

**Erica:** Of sticking up long hair. 

**Marco:** Okay, and that's a mohawk. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** What about a flat-top? 

**Erica:** Oh, um, popular with law enforcement agents and serial killers. 

**Marco:** Hehe. So, basically it's short hair on the sides… 

**Erica:** And short and flat hair on the top. 

**Marco:** Right, so your hair… 

**Erica:** Kind of like a box. 

**Marco:** Right, you have… it's flat on top… 

**Erica:** Kind of like your haircut. 

**Marco:** Hehe. I do no have a flat-top for all of you out there, uh, but I did used to have a crew-

cut. 

**Erica:** Oh, crew-cut. 

**Marco:** A crew-cut. 

**Erica:** Yeah. Like an army haircut. 

**Marco:** Right, so, very short on the sides… 

**Erica:** Uh. 

**Marco:** And a little bit long on top. 

**Erica:** Yeah, okay, um, and out last one, my actual personal least favorite haircut. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Dreadlocks. 

**Erica:** Dreadlocks. 

**Marco:** Alright, so… so dreadlocks are, uh… knots of hair, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, um, it looks like you haven't washed your hair in about seven years. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Right, those are dreadlocks. Very popular among like Rastafarians and… 

**Erica:** Sure, or like, um, young hippie kids. 

**Marco:** Hippies, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Very good. So… what about in your countries? What different hairstyles are popular there? I know that Japanese hairstyles are really cool. 

**Erica:** Yeah, that's right, uh, Japanese haircuts can be pretty awesome.
