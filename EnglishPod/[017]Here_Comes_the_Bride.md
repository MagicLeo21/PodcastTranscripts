## Here Comes the Bride

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! And welcome back to another episode of EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today with Erica we are getting married. 

**Erica:** Well, we're not getting married. 

**Marco:** Hehe. We're not, but our actors in the podcast are. 

**Erica:** That's right, so, we"ve got a lesson today about weddings. And you know what, a lot of the language in this lesson is about weddings and marriages and maybe you don't need to use this language everyday, but… 

**Marco:** Learning this vocabulary will definitely help you understand or learn a lot more about Anglo culture. 

**Erica:** Okay, great point, Marco, I think now we can look at our "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** So, two simple words in this vocabulary preview; the first one is groom. 

**Marco:** Groom. 

**Erica:** Groom. 

**Marco:** Groom. 

**Erica:** So, who is the groom? 

**Marco:** He's the man, the man that's getting married. 

**Erica:** Okay, and our second word is… 

**Marco:** Bride. 

**Erica:** Bride. 

**Marco:** Bride. 

**Erica:** And obviously the bride is… 

**Marco:** The woman getting married. 

**Erica:** Perfect. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Now we have our bride and our groom, so, it's time to listen to our dialogue the first time. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

> A: I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married!

> B: Yeah well it's about time! He's been living with his parents for 40 years!

> A: Don't be mean. Look here come the bridesmaids!
Their dresses look beautiful!

> B: Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

> A: That's the flower girl and the ring bearer. I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, they look so cute!

> B: I just hope the priest makes it quick. I'm starving. I hope the food's good at the reception.

> A: That's all you ever think about, food! Oh, I think the bride's coming now! She looks gorgeous. Wait, what's she doing? Where's she going?

> B: Oh great! Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

**Erica:** Oh, Marco, that sounds sad. 

**Marco:** Yeah, I know the reception is cancelled now. 

**Erica:** Marco! 

**Marco:** Well… 

**Erica:** They're not getting married! 

**Marco:** Uh, well, I mean… the best part is when you go and eat and drink at a reception. 

**Erica:** Okay. Well, there's some great language in this dialogue and now let's look at our "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Great, our first word on the language takeaway today is it's about time. 

**Erica:** It's about time. 

**Marco:** It's about time. 

**Erica:** It's about time. 

**Marco:** So, now we are going to listen to some examples on how we use this great phrase. 

**Example One** 

> A: Dinners' ready. 

> B: It's about time! I'm starving! 

**Example Two** 

> C: Guess what? I finally got a job. 

> D: It's about time! You've been unemployed for two years! 

**Example Three** 

> E: We're almost there. Just a couple more minutes. 

> F: It's about time. We've been driving for twelve hours. 

**Erica:** So, this phrase means "finally". 

**Marco:** Finally! At last. 

**Erica:** We"ve been waiting a long time for this. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, it's about time. 

**Marco:** Great, let's take a look at our second word now – aisle. 

**Erica:** Aisle. 

**Marco:** A-I-S-L-E. 

**Erica:** Aisle. 

**Marco:** Aisle. It's a tricky word, it sounds like the contraction of "I will". 

**Erica:** Yeah, but it's spelled so strangely. 

**Marco:** Right, we don't pronounce the S, the S is silent, it"s… 

**Erica:** That's true. 

**Marco:** Ai-le. 

**Erica:** So, what is an aisle? 

**Marco:** In a big room where you have a lot chairs that space in the middle that allows people to walk through, that's the aisle. 

**Erica:** So, the aisle is the part where you walk. 

**Marco:** Yes. 

**Erica:** In a big room. 

**Marco:** In a big room, wh… 

**Erica:** With many chairs. 

**Marco:** With many chairs. Hehe. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, in the church… 

**Erica:** The bride and groom… 

**Marco:** Walk down the aisle. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Great. 

**Erica:** Let's move to our third word… 

**Marco:** Bridesmaid. 

**Erica:** Bridesmaid. 

**Marco:** Bridesmaid. 

**Erica:** So, who are the bridesmaids? Or wait, maybe you ask me that. 

**Marco:** Yeah, cause I… I… we don't get bridesmaids. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, the bridesmaids are the women who are friends of the bride who stand next to her when she's getting married. Usually, they're her best friends. 

**Marco:** Right, okay. Okay, so, we have our bridesmaids, now we have our flower girl. 

**Erica:** Flower girl. 

**Marco:** Flower girl. 

**Erica:** Again, I'll explain this one. 

**Marco:** Please, please. 

**Erica:** The flower girl is the cute little girl who walks down the aisle and who throws flowers. 

**Marco:** That's the flower girl. And with the flower girl we have our ring bearer. 

**Erica:** Ring bearer. 

**Marco:** Ring bearer. 

**Erica:** So, the ring bearer is the cute little boy who walks down the aisle carrying the… 

**Marco:** Rings. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, a lot of useful vocabulary for a wedding ceremony. 

**Erica:** That's true. 

**Marco:** Now, let's look at our last word – gorgeous. 

**Erica:** Gorgeous. 

**Marco:** Gorgeous. 

**Erica:** Gorgeous means beautiful. 

**Marco:** Very beautiful. 

**Erica:** Yeah, i… you know, beautiful you can only use with a woman. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Can you use gorgeous with a woman or with a man? 

**Marco:** Yes, gorgeous is unisex. 

**Erica:** So, both men and women are gorgeous. 

**Marco:** Right, you can say "Oh, that girl is gorgeous". 

**Erica:** That guy is gorgeous. 

**Marco:** Right, or you can say even "This house is gorgeous". 

**Erica:** Okay, so, men, women, objects. 

**Marco:** Yes, yes. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, we"ve learned some really interesting vocabulary that will help us to understand an Anglo wedding, so, why don't we listen to the dialogue slow down? 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

> A: I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married!

> B: Yeah well it's about time! He's been living with his parents for 40 years!

> A: Don't be mean. Look here come the bridesmaids!
Their dresses look beautiful!

> B: Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

> A: That's the flower girl and the ring bearer. I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, they look so cute!

> B: I just hope the priest makes it quick. I'm starving. I hope the food's good at the reception.

> A: That's all you ever think about, food! Oh, I think the bride's coming now! She looks gorgeous. Wait, what's she doing? Where's she going?

> B: Oh great! Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

**Marco:** Now, in this dialogue we have a word that many students often make mistakes on. 

**Erica:** So, this is a word that causes a lot of problems. 

**Marco:** Yes, the word marry. 

**Erica:** Marry. 

**Marco:** Marry, right? So, we are going to listen now to some common mistakes on how English learners use this word. 

**Erica:** Right, so, these are wrong examples. 

**Example One** 

> A: Honey, let's marry. 

**Example Two** 

> B: We married four years ago. 

**Example Three** 

> C: When I marry I wanna huge wedding. 

**Erica:** These are great examples of mistakes students make with the word marry. They're missing a word. Let's listen to these right examples to see what word is missing. 

**Example One** 

> A: Honey, let's get married. 

**Example Two** 

> B: We got married four years ago. 

**Example Three** 

> C: When I get married I wanna huge wedding. 

**Marco:** Great, so, we can see that when we use the word marry, we say to get married. 

**Erica:** Exactly right! Get married. 

**Marco:** To get married, right? 

**Erica:** Okay, don't forget that. 

**Marco:** Yes, get married. I will get married. 

**Erica:** We got married. 

**Marco:** Right, so, now you know exactly how to use this word, we are ready to listen to our dialogue again for a third time and this time it's gonna be at a normal speed. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

> A: I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married!

> B: Yeah well it's about time! He's been living with his parents for 40 years!

> A: Don't be mean. Look here come the bridesmaids!
Their dresses look beautiful!

> B: Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

> A: That's the flower girl and the ring bearer. I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, they look so cute!

> B: I just hope the priest makes it quick. I'm starving. I hope the food's good at the reception.

> A: That's all you ever think about, food! Oh, I think the bride's coming now! She looks gorgeous. Wait, what's she doing? Where's she going?

> B: Oh great! Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

**Marco:** Okay, well, I'm gonna be honest with you, I don't know too much about marriages, because, first of all, I'm not married and I"ve never really been too many marriages, so, Erica, some questions for you. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** What are these bridesmaids do… I mean… What are they… what are they about? 

**Erica:** What do the bridesmaids do? 

**Marco:** Yeah, what are they… what are they doing there? 

**Erica:** Well, like I said earlier, the bridesmaids are the friends of the bride, but the most important people besides the bride and groom are the best man and the maid of honor. 

**Marco:** Okay, and what do they do there, in the ceremony? 

**Erica:** Well, what they do is they sign the marriage license. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, they're like witnesses. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, but wait a minute, they sign the marriage license there in the church? 

**Erica:** Yeah, of course, right inside the church you sign the marriage license. 

**Marco:** Wow, that's strange, because from what I know, in other countries usually you will sign the marriage license before the ceremony. 

**Erica:** So, you get married twice. 

**Marco:** Yeah, you have like the civil marriage and then you have like the church wedding or whatever. 

**Erica:** That's so complicated. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, yeah, I mean the church wedding is just a ceremony; it's not really anything official. 

**Erica:** Oh, in Canada it's the official part as well. 

**Marco:** I guess maybe it's just more efficient. 

**Erica:** Maybe. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Well, this is a really fascinating, a really interesting subject, isn't it? 

**Marco:** Yeah, because there're so many countries that have different marriage ceremonies. I know that marriages in India last around seven days. 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. I wanna know more about how our users get married in their country[s]. 

**Marco:** Yeah, so, please go to our website at englishpod.com and tell us how you get married in your countries. 

**Erica:** Yeah, I can't wait to hear your stories. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it should be interesting, right? 

**Erica:** Okay, well, everyone thanks for listening and until next time… Good bye! 

**Marco:** Bye!
