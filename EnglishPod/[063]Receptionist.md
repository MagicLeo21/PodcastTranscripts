## Receptionist

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you a lesson that was requested by one of our listeners. 

**Erica:** Yes, that's right. We got a request for a dialogue about a receptionist. 

**Marco:** So, a receptionist at an office or at a hotel… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, today's dialogue is simple, but we're gonna be looking at some really great phrases. 

**Erica:** Yeah, phrases that will help you sound really, really professional and really fluent. 

**Marco:** So, we're at an office today and the receptionist is greeting somebody that has an appointment. 

**Erica:** Alright, let's see what happens. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Erica:** Well, that's pretty embarrassing, hey? 

**Marco:** It was embarrassing I… that's what happens to women when they wear high heels, see? 

**Erica:** Actually, that happened to me last weekend. 

**Marco:** Really? 

**Erica:** I fell down the stairs, so my… my knees are quite blue. 

**Marco:** Oh no, see? High heels are dangerous. I don't know why women wear them. 

**Erica:** Well… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** I don't know, but that's not what we're here to discover. 

**Marco:** Right, okay, so, let's take a look at some of these great phases in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** Well, I really liked how this receptionist used some excellent phrases to sound really professional and one thing she said was certainly. 

**Marco:** Certainly. 

**Erica:** Certainly. 

**Marco:** So why did she say certainly? 

**Erica:** Well, this is a nice way to respond, um, to make the other person know that you understand what they said. 

**Marco:** So, Josh O'Neil said "Yes, I'm here to see Joanna Stevens. I have an appointment at four". 

**Erica:** Certainly. 

**Marco:** So, she is saying, I understand what you said. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And then she said, may I take your name. 

**Erica:** May I take your name. 

**Marco:** May I take your name. 

**Erica:** So, this is a nice way of saying… 

**Marco:** What is your name? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So… now, this is really important, because if you said "what is your name", is that correct? 

**Erica:** It's correct, but it's not really very… 

**Marco:** Exactly, or I would say polite, to a certain extent. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, may I take your name. 

**Marco:** May I take your name. 

**Erica:** You use this phrase when you're going to write down the person's name. 

**Marco:** Right, so, if you meet somebody in, ah… on the street or at a bar, you wouldn't say "may I take your name". 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Unless you're going to write it down. 

**Marco:** Hehe. So, usually, for an office setting where the receptionist has to write down the name. 

**Erica:** Yes, alright, one more phrase, Ms. Stevens will be with you momentarily. 

**Marco:** Okay, Ms. Stevens will be with you momentarily. 

**Erica:** Will be with you momentarily. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, this is really polite. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Momentarily, what does that mean? 

**Erica:** In a moment. 

**Marco:** In a moment. 

**Erica:** Soon. 

**Marco:** Soon. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Again, she could have said Ms. Stevens will come out soon or Ms. Stevens will see you in a minute. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** But that's… again, it's not really that polite, right? 

**Erica:** So, when you want to be formal, you can say Ms. Stevens will be with you momentarily. 

**Marco:** Okay, that's a really nice phrase. 

**Erica:** Alright, there's so much in this dialogue, so many great wonderful polite phrases. So, why don't we listen to it one more time, but this time slowed down? 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it's pretty clear now, but there're still a couple of phrases that I would like to look at. So, why don't we look at, ah, last two sentences. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Ms. Stevens is ready for you now. 

**Erica:** Ms. Stevens is ready for you now. 

**Marco:** Ms. Stevens is ready for you. So, when she says ready for you, what does that mean? 

**Erica:** Prepared to speak to you. 

**Marco:** Okay, so instead of saying Ms. Stevens is ready or Ms. Stevens can see you now… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** You use this great little phrase, is ready for you. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, and then she said I'll show you to her office. 

**Erica:** I'll show you to her office. 

**Marco:** I'll show you to her office. 

**Erica:** This is a lovely way of saying I will take you to the office. 

**Marco:** I will take you to the office. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And she followed it by saying right this way. 

**Erica:** Right this way. 

**Marco:** Right this way. 

**Erica:** So, again, walk this way. 

**Marco:** Walk this way. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** This way, please. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Right this way. 

**Erica:** It sounds… it sounds really really nice, really polite, really welcoming. 

**Marco:** Right, and especially if you use it together, right? I'll show you to her office, right this way, please. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it's a really great way of being polite to somebody at an office. 

**Erica:** Now, the final useful phrase, watch your step. 

**Marco:** Watch your step. 

**Erica:** Watch your step. 

**Marco:** So, watch your step. You see that everywhere on signs. 

**Erica:** Yeah. Be careful. 

**Marco:** Be careful where you step. 

**Erica:** Yes, be careful where you're walking. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, obviously, she didn't watch her step and… 

**Erica:** She fell. 

**Marco:** She fell. Okay, so really great phrases, let's listen to this dialogue one last time. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, a really simple dialogue, but with a lot of good phrases in there and it's also a good review for more advanced students, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, remember like these phrases can really help you sound more professional, more welcoming, more polite, basically.
