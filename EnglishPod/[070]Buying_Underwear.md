## Buying Underwear

---

**Marco:** Hello, everyone! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you a very… I would say, embarrassing lesson for us men. 

**Erica:** Right, embarrassing for men, but, I think, uh, it's okay for women. 

**Marco:** Hehe. That's right. We're gonna be talking about buying underwear, specifically women's underwear. 

**Erica:** Right, so, um, obviously not the favorite thing for men to do. 

**Marco:** Well, apart from being a little bit uncomfortable, it's also boring. [NOTE: apart from = besides] 

**Erica:** Yeah, it involves shopping, right? 

**Marco:** Involves shopping, so we… we're not really big on that. 

**Erica:** Alright, but… well, even though it might be a little bit of an uncomfortable, um, topic, there's some great language in here, isn't there? 

**Marco:** Yeah, there's some really good words and, of course, ah… the different types of underwear, that we're gonna be looking at. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But we also have some words that we're gonna take a look at before we get into our dialogue, so let's start with vocabulary preview. 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Well, we're gonna look at two words that will appear in our dialogue. And the first one is lingerie. 

**Marco:** Lingerie. 

**Erica:** Lingerie. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, lingerie. This is a nice fancy word. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Basically for underwear, right? 

**Erica:** Right, for women's underwear. 

**Marco:** Women's underwear. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, lingerie, but it's very nice, very… 

**Erica:** Like pretty sexy. 

**Marco:** Sexy underwear. 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. Now, the spelling of this word is interesting, isn't it? 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's spelled L-I-N-G-E-R-I-E. 

**Erica:** Lingerie. 

**Marco:** Lingerie. 

**Erica:** Yes, don't you love English spellings? 

**Marco:** Hehe. So, women's nice, pretty sexy underwear. 

**Erica:** That's right. And our second word, awkward. 

**Marco:** Awkward. 

**Erica:** Awkward. 

**Marco:** Awkward. 

**Erica:** So, this is a feeling that men have, especially when they're buying women's underwear. 

**Marco:** Well, yeah, you feel a little bit uncomfortable… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or it's a strange situation. 

**Erica:** Or weird… 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** Or out of place. [NOTE: out of place = inappropriate] 

**Marco:** It's awkward. 

**Erica:** Yes. Alright, so, we're gonna be hearing both of these two words in the dialogue. Now, Marco, where are we here? 

**Marco:** We're gonna be at a department store at the section, where they have women's, uh, lingerie and we have a guy buying underwear for his girlfriend. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, let's find out what happens. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Erica:** Oh, the poor guy, I totally feel bad for him. 

**Marco:** Yeah, he was really nervous and, of course, it was very uncomfortable for him. 

**Erica:** I know and then the security guard shows up and… 

**Marco:** Hehe. Exactly. But we have an opportunity to take a look at some really great words and phrases, so let's start off with our first on in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, we're gonna look at words here that mostly have to do with underwear, describing underwear. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** And the first one is granny panties. 

**Marco:** Granny panties. 

**Erica:** Granny panties. 

**Marco:** This isn't like a real, real word, right? It's not something that you find in the dictionary. 

**Erica:** No, it's a slang word, um, and we use it to describe really big, ugly underwear like your grandmother would wear. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, they're not like the sexy little underwear. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** It's more like long and it's not very appealing ??? [NOTE: appealing = attractive] 

**Erica:** Just picture what your grandmother would wear. 

**Marco:** Hehe. No. 

**Erica:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, granny panties. 

**Erica:** So, obviously, uh, this guy doesn't want to be buying any of those, but the saleswoman suggests that he try some sleep wear. 

**Marco:** Sleep wear. 

**Erica:** Sleep wear. 

**Marco:** Sleep wear. Okay, so, sleep wear. 

**Erica:** Obviously, clothes you wear when you're sleeping. 

**Marco:** Now, this is really interesting, because men aren't really that complicated when they come to sleeping. Just… throw on a t-shirt and that's it. [NOTE: throw on = put on quickly] 

**Erica:** Well, obviously, for women there're more options an… and more different things you can chose from, so… 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** It's a whole separate category for women. 

**Marco:** I know. Even when you're sleeping, you must wear something nice. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** One type of sleep wear is silky nighties. 

**Erica:** Nighties. 

**Marco:** Nighties. 

**Erica:** N-I-G-H-T-I-E-S. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, a nighty. 

**Erica:** Um, it's basically a dress that you wear when you sleep. 

**Marco:** Okay. Now, the pronunciation is interesting, because the first five letters are night. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** Right? But you don't say nighT. 

**Erica:** You don't say nighTy. 

**Marco:** You say nighDy. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you… you make the T a D. 

**Marco:** Hm. 

**Erica:** NighDy. 

**Marco:** Now, she offered him some silky nighties. 

**Erica:** Right, so, silky. Obviously, we know silk. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Is a soft, shiny fabric, right? 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So, when something is silky, it's either made from silk or it's… 

**Marco:** The similar. 

**Erica:** Soft and shiny. 

**Marco:** Okay, so… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Some silky nighties - very soft, shiny, uh, nighties. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay. What about our next word? 

**Erica:** Well, the salesgirl offers different styles of undies. 

**Marco:** Undies. 

**Erica:** Undies. 

**Marco:** Undies. 

**Erica:** So, undies is an interesting word. It's basically short for underwear. 

**Marco:** Underwear, okay. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, you can just call underwear undies. 

**Erica:** Yes, but I think you mostly use this when you're talking about women's underwear. 

**Marco:** Oh, really? 

**Erica:** I mean I don't know I would say undies when I'm talking about men's underwear. 

**Marco:** No, I don't think so. Maybe children's underwear. 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, for children. Yep. 

**Marco:** For children, right? 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay. Alright, so, we saw some of the different types of clothing, but now, let's take a look at this interesting adjective, mortifying. 

**Erica:** Mortifying. 

**Marco:** This is mortifying. 

**Erica:** Mortifying. 

**Marco:** Okay, so… when something is mortifying… 

**Erica:** Well, I think, we've got some examples to show you what that is like. 

**Example One** 

> A: And then I fell in front of everyone. It was mortifying! 

**Example Two** 

> B: I was completely mortified, when I realized what I had done. 

**Example Three** 

> C: It must've been mortifying for her, when she realized that her underwear was showing. 

**Marco:** So, basically, it's very embarrassing. 

**Erica:** Super embarrassing. 

**Marco:** You want to die almost. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Which is… I… interesting. I mean, mort. 

**Marco:** Right, from… 

**Erica:** French. 

**Marco:** Mourir. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Interesting. Alright, well, um, etymology, here at EnglishPod. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, so, some interesting… Okay, so, we saw the different types of underwear, we saw this really great word for when you're really embarrassed.

**Marco:** I wanna leave. 

**Erica:** Right now. 

**Marco:** Now, when you're using this… this phrase of this sentence, uh, "get the hell out of here", is it really polite? 

**Erica:** No, of course not, it's… it's impolite. 

**Marco:** Okay, so…

**Marco:** Very negative and informal, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Marco:** So you would use this maybe with your friends or th… like in this case think it to your self. 

**Erica:** Yes, but it's not a good idea to use with your boss or your mother.

**Erica:** Alright, well, interesting phrases and I think w… it would help us to hear them once more in context in the dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, I guess the situation is very common: men either having to shop for this type of article for their girlfriend or wife… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Because it's their birthday… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or sometimes we get dragged into a store to… to buy this… 

**Erica:** So you're shopping with your girlfriend and she's gonna make you go look at underwear with her. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Yeah, I usually don't do that, though. I just, uh, go to the next section and just look around. 

**Erica:** Look at tools. 

**Marco:** Look at tools. 

**Erica:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** Hehe. TVs… 

**Erica:** Yeah 

**Marco:** And play stations. 

**Erica:** Yes, but you know what, I have seen some men, who go shopping with their girlfriends or wives and actually enjoy buying underwear. 

**Marco:** See, that's the thing… I think i… i… it makes sense, but I don't know how comfortable you're actually be. I don't know why. I guess it just a… how it indicates sexuality and other stuff. 

**Erica:** Yeah, well… 

**Marco:** I… I could do it for maybe five or ten minutes, give my professional advice… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And then I'm out of there. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, maybe those guys, who look like they're enjoying themselves are just really talking in their heads… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Um, telling themselves how much they hate this. 

**Marco:** Exactly, maybe they just, uh… 

**Erica:** They're pretending. 

**Marco:** Pretending or listening to their IPod. 

**Erica:** Well, tell us… well, guys… I know we've got a lot of male listeners… tell us what you think, um… are you embarrassed by women's underwear? 

**Marco:** Right, or, women, why aren't you embarrassed when you buy men's underwear for your boyfriend or husband?
