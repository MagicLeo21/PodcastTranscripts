## I Can See Clearly Now

---

**Erica:** Well, hello everyone! And welcome to EnglishPod! My name's Erica. 

**Marco:** And I'm Marco. 

**Erica:** So, Marco, how're you doing today? 

**Marco:** I'm doing great and I'm really looking forward to our lesson, because we're going to the eye doctor today. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, we"ve got an elementary lesson about going to the eye doctor. 

**Marco:** Yes! 

**Erica:** Well, let's get started then with our "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** We have three words today in our vocabulary preview. All three words come from our dialogue. Our first word is struggle. 

**Marco:** Struggle. 

**Erica:** Struggle. 

**Marco:** Struggle. 

**Erica:** So, Marco, when I struggle to do something, what does that mean? 

**Marco:** It means it's difficult, it means that you have a hard time, so you can't really do it very quickly. 

**Erica:** So, what you have to try really hard. 

**Marco:** You have to try really hard. 

**Erica:** Yeah, to do something that's difficult. 

**Marco:** Yes. 

**Erica:** Okay, our next word is… 

**Marco:** Blurry. 

**Erica:** Blurry. 

**Marco:** Blurry. 

**Erica:** Blurry. B-L-U-R-R-Y. 

**Marco:** Blurry. Whenever something is blurry, you can't really see it well. 

**Erica:** It's not clear. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** That's right, everything will be blurry. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Okay. And our final word is… 

**Marco:** Prescription. 

**Erica:** Prescription. 

**Marco:** Prescription. 

**Erica:** Often when you go to the doctor and you need some medicine, he writes out a prescription. 

**Marco:** Right, a little paper that says all the medicine that you need and then you can go to the drug store and buy it. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, those three words you'll hear in today's dialogue and I think it's time we listen to the dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Erica:** Well, this guy really has poor vision, hey? 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Well, actually, you know what, I"ve walked in to the bathroom, the men's bathroom, actually, instead of the women's bathroom. And that's not "cause I wasn't wearing my glasses. 

**Marco:** It's because you weren't paying attention. 

**Erica:** That's true. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, let's take a look today at out "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** The first word on our language takeaway for today is twenty/twenty (20/20) vision. 

**Erica:** 20/20 vision. 

**Marco:** 20/20 vision. 

**Erica:** If I have 20/20 vision… 

**Marco:** It means that you have perfect vision. 

**Erica:** Which I do not have. 

**Marco:** Hehe. No, me neither, so, I… I usually wear glasses as well. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But, yeah, people that have 20/20 vision don't need glasses, they can see clearly with… 

**Erica:** And perfectly. 

**Marco:** And perfectly. 

**Erica:** Yeah. Next word is far-sighted. 

**Marco:** Far-sighted. 

**Erica:** Far-sighted. 

**Marco:** Far-sighted. 

**Erica:** So, if I'm far-sighted, I can't see very well, right? 

**Marco:** So, if you're far-sighted, you can't see things that are near. 

**Erica:** So, you can see things that are faraway. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** But thing that are close are blurry. Okay. 

**Marco:** And the opposite would be… 

**Erica:** Near-sighted. 

**Marco:** And which is… 

**Erica:** You can see things that are close well… 

**Marco:** But not far. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Far-sighted and near-sighted. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, our next word is make out. 

**Marco:** Make out. 

**Erica:** Make out. 

**Marco:** Make out. 

**Erica:** Make out, that's kind of a funny little phrase. And let's listen to a few examples of this phrase, so we can understand how it's used. 

**Example One** 

> A: I can't make out what this says. The writing is too small. 

**Example Two** 

> B: If you look carefully, you can almost make out a few of the stars in the sky. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Can you see what's written on the sign there? 

> D: No, I can't quite make it out. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, basically, make out is to see clearly. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Uhu, make out. 

**Erica:** To see. 

**Marco:** Okay. And our last word for language takeaway today is blind as a bat. 

**Erica:** Blind as a bet. 

**Marco:** Blind as a bet. 

**Erica:** So, this is a really funny sounding expression, one of these weird English idioms. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's a really common expression that just means that you can't see. 

**Erica:** Exactly, so, it's not like you actually are blind, right? 

**Marco:** But you just really can't see very well. 

**Erica:** Okay. Alright, we saw four great words today in our language takeaway, now I think we can listen to our dialogue another time. 

**Marco:** But this time it's gonna be slower, so we can pick up all these great words that we just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Alright, great stuff on our dialogue and with this we can start now with "Putting it together". 

**Putting It Together** 

**Erica:** So, we saw a couple of useful phrases in this dialogue and I think we can show you how to use these phrases in a few different ways. 

**Marco:** Right, um, the first one that we have today is what seems to be. 

**Erica:** So, we heard in the dialogue the doctor said… 

**Marco:** "What seems to be the problem?" 

**Erica:** We can use this same expression in a number of different ways. Let's listen. 

**Example One** 

> A: What seems to be the problem? 

**Example Two** 

> B: What seems to be the matter? 

**Example Three** 

> C: What seems to be the trouble? 

**Marco:** Okay, so, with these examples we can see how we can use the phrase what seems to be in many different ways. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's a great way of asking "What's the problem?" 

**Marco:** So, now let's take a look at another phrase. 

**Erica:** We heard in the dialogue the doctor said "Head on over to the other room". 

**Marco:** Right, and with this phrase head on we can combine it with other prepositions to indicate another place. 

**Erica:** Exactly, let's hear three examples. 

**Example One** 

> A: Head on in. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Head on out. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Head on up. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, for example, we can say "Head on into the house, it's gonna rain soon". 

**Erica:** Or we can say "Hey guys, let's head on out to the park". 

**Marco:** Uhu, or I can also say "Head on up to my room, I'll be there in a second". 

**Erica:** Great! Those are some cool phrases. 

**Marco:** Right, and they're really useful. 

**Erica:** So, why don't we listen to our dialogue and maybe we'll hear them again. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, talking about going to the eye doctor today, I have a question for our listeners. 

**Erica:** A challenge for our listeners. 

**Marco:** A challenge. What's it called when you can't distinguish colors? 

**Erica:** So, like when you can't tell the difference between read and blue and green. 

**Marco:** Right, so, what is that condition called? So… 

**Erica:** There's like a technical term, we want the technical term. 

**Marco:** Hehe. We want the technical term. So, we'll be looking for it on our comments" page and be sure to… if you know the answer, post it.
