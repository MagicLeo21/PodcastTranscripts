## Can I ask you a favor

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson today. One that takes place at the office. 

**Erica:** Yes, today we're gonna teach you some great phrases, so that you can ask people to help you. 

**Marco:** Right. And I think this dialogue is with a new person at the office. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, when you're new, you always need to ask people for favors. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, we're gonna be asking for a favor. 

**Erica:** So, Marco, what exactly is a favor? 

**Marco:** Something that a person does for you. 

**Erica:** Like a small helpful thing. 

**Marco:** Ah, Yeah, a small helpful thing, so… 

**Erica:** Uh. 

**Marco:** You know, like "can you pass me that pencil". Maybe that's even a favor. 

**Erica:** Yeah, or… 

**Marco:** Or… 

**Erica:** Maybe, uh, can you pick me up on your way to work. 

**Marco:** Yeah, that's a favor. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Or even lending money… 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** To your friend. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** That's a favor. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, that's what we're gonna be talking about – favors and how to ask for one. 

**Erica:** Cause you always have to do this at work. 

**Marco:** At work, with your friends. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** With your family. So, let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all the vocabulary. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

> A: Um, sorry to bother you, um… my name is Rachel. I'm new here. Can I ask you a favor?

> B: Hi Rachel, welcome on board. I'm afraid I can't help you right now. I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

> A: Excuse me, but can I bother you for a sec?

> C: You know what, I'd love to help you, but I'm about to meet an important client. Do you wanna try Sean instead? He sits right over there.

> A: Sorry to interrupt you Sean, could you do me a quick favor?

> D: Actually, I'm working on a document that is due in a couple minutes. I really can't talk to you right now. Sorry about that.

> A: Geeze! I just want to know where the bathroom is! What's wrong with you people!

**Marco:** So, a pretty busy office. 

**Erica:** Pretty unhelpful colleagues. 

**Marco:** Hehe. I know everyone so busy… 

**Erica:** I know. 

**Marco:** They didn't help this poor girl. 

**Erica:** Yeah, I hope she found the bathroom. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Now, let's take a look at the language from the dialogue. So, let's start with language takeaway. 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** There's some great language in this dialogue, wasn't there? 

**Marco:** Yeah, a lot of, uh, interesting phrases and words. Um, the first one that… that I saw that was really interesting is on board. 

**Erica:** On board. 

**Marco:** Welcome on board. 

**Erica:** Well, we've got some examples of how this phrase is used. So, let's listen to them to help us understand the meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: Welcome on board, Sarah; if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. 

**Example Two** 

> B: We need to get a new office assistant on board as soon as possible. 

**Example Three** 

> C: We decided to bring Melissa on board to join the marketing team. 

**Marco:** So, basically it means… 

**Erica:** Welcome to the company. 

**Marco:** Welcome to the company. 

**Erica:** Or. 

**Marco:** The team. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Welcome on board. 

**Erica:** So, "on board" is the same as "to the company". 

**Marco:** I guess also when you get on a ship, they tell you "welcome on board". 

**Erica:** Yes. That's where it comes from. 

**Marco:** Or an airplane. 

**Erica:** Yeah-yeah, yeah. 

**Marco:** Welcome on board. Okay, let's take a look at our next word – about to. 

**Erica:** About to. 

**Marco:** I'm about to. 

**Erica:** I'm about to. 

**Marco:** So, this a great phrase to explain that you're about to do something. 

**Erica:** I'm going to do this thing really soon. 

**Marco:** Okay, so… so, for example, you can say "I'm about to go out for lunch". 

**Erica:** Uhu. Or I could say "hey, Marco, let's go record a show". 

**Marco:** I'm about to going to a meeting. 

**Erica:** Uhu, exactly. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** About to. 

**Erica:** Going to do something really soon. 

**Marco:** Okay. The next word we have is instead. 

**Erica:** Instead. 

**Marco:** Instead. 

**Erica:** Instead. It means in the place of. 

**Marco:** In the place of. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, for example, if for a dinner I could say "I'll have the chicken instead of the fish". 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Or I can say "I wanted to buy a red sweater, but they didn't have one, so I bought a blue one instead". 

**Marco:** Instead. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, in the place of. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And our last word for… language takeaway – interrupt. 

**Erica:** Interrupt. 

**Marco:** Interrupt. 

**Erica:** Interrupt. 

**Marco:** So, when somebody interrupts you, they're coming and… 

**Erica:** The talk to you while you're doing something or maybe while you're speaking. 

**Marco:** Or maybe you're busy… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** And people come and… and… 

**Erica:** Bother you. 

**Marco:** And bother you. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, interrupt. 

**Marco:** Interrupt. Okay, some great words here in our dialogue and now we can listen to it again. This time it's gonna be a little bit slower… 

**Erica:** And you'll be able to understand the language a little bit better. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

> A: Um, sorry to bother you, um… my name is Rachel. I'm new here. Can I ask you a favor?

> B: Hi Rachel, welcome on board. I'm afraid I can't help you right now. I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

> A: Excuse me, but can I bother you for a sec?

> C: You know what, I'd love to help you, but I'm about to meet an important client. Do you wanna try Sean instead? He sits right over there.

> A: Sorry to interrupt you Sean, could you do me a quick favor?

> D: Actually, I'm working on a document that is due in a couple minutes. I really can't talk to you right now. Sorry about that.

> A: Geeze! I just want to know where the bathroom is! What's wrong with you people!

**Marco:** Okay, so, there're some great ways that you can ask someone for a favor, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, we wanna show you some really useful phrases for asking for help. 

**Marco:** So, let's start with "putting it together". 

**Putting It Together** 

**Erica:** Let's listen to some different ways of how you can ask someone for a favor. 

**Example One** 

> A: May I get you to do me a favor? Can you carry this package and that suitcase for me? 

**Example Two** 

> B: Can I ask you a favor? Can you just finish this report for me? 

**Example Three** 

> C: Could you do me a favor and pass me that file. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, those were great examples of asking for a favor. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** In our dialogue we heard "Can I ask you a favor". 

**Erica:** Uhu. But we could also say "Can I get you to do me a favor". 

**Marco:** Right, can I get you to do me a favor. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Also I could say "Will you do me a favor". 

**Erica:** Will you do me a favor. 

**Marco:** Right. So, those are different ways of asking for a favor. 

**Erica:** Let's say you want to ask someone for a favor, right? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** But they're busy. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So, you'll need some phrases to help you do this. 

**Marco:** Exactly, you need some phrases to interrupt somebody. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Right? So, let's listen to some examples of what phrases you can use to begin to talk to someone. 

**Erica:** Yeah, to interrupt them. 

**Marco:** Okay. Example 1: I hate to bother you, but… I hate to bother you, but… Example 2: I'm sorry to bother you, but… I'm sorry to bother you, but… Example 3: I don't mean to bother you, but… I don't mean to bother you, but… 

**Marco:** Okay, so, those are really nice and polite ways of beginning to talk to someone. 

**Erica:** Exactly, they're really useful at the office. 

**Marco:** So, maybe you wanna talk to your boss, you knock on his door, kind of open it a little bit and say "I'm sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you have time for meeting today". 

**Erica:** Uhu. Or you could say "I hate to bother you, but do you have time for a meeting today". 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, those are great ways of starting up a conversation. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** And maybe setting it up to ask for a favor. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, we can combine them. I could say "I hate to bother you, but can you do me a favor". 

**Erica:** Perfect. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, really useful. 

**Marco:** So, then… then you can ask someone for a favor. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, great stuff. So, I guess we can listen to our dialogue again. 

**Erica:** Yeah, let's listen to our dialogue for the third time and this time I'm sure you'll understand it a lot better. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

> A: Um, sorry to bother you, um… my name is Rachel. I'm new here. Can I ask you a favor?

> B: Hi Rachel, welcome on board. I'm afraid I can't help you right now. I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

> A: Excuse me, but can I bother you for a sec?

> C: You know what, I'd love to help you, but I'm about to meet an important client. Do you wanna try Sean instead? He sits right over there.
