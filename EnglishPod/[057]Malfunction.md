## Malfunction

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're back in the office, we have a lesson that's talking about something that goes wrong in the office. 

**Erica:** Yeah, something that I can really understand well, but we'll talk about that later. So this lesson is about a photocopier. 

**Marco:** A photocopier, so let's take a look at this word in "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Marco:** Alright, so a photocopier makes copies. 

**Erica:** Yeah. It makes copies of documents. We often call it a copier… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Or a copy machine. 

**Marco:** Uhu. Yeah, so you can call it a photocopier, copy machine or copier. 

**Erica:** Yes, or a Xerox machine as well. 

**Marco:** Xerox machine, yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** We can talk about that a little bit later, cause that's an interesting story. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Alright, let's take a look at our next word, tonner. 

**Erica:** Tonner. 

**Marco:** Tonner. 

**Erica:** Tonner. 

**Marco:** So, tonner is what the copy machine uses to make copies. 

**Erica:** It's like the… the ink. 

**Marco:** Right, ah, it's a very fine black powder. 

**Erica:** Ouh. 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Erica:** So, it's not an ink. 

**Marco:** No, it's actually dry. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah, it's a… it's dry, it's… it's a powder, so you don't' wanna get that all over you. 

**Erica:** Alright. Well, good advice, Marco, and… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** And our last word in vocabulary preview, malfunction. 

**Marco:** Malfunction. 

**Erica:** Malfunction. 

**Marco:** Malfunction. 

**Erica:** Let's break down this word [NOTE: here break down means "analyze" or "take to pieces"] 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** Function? 

**Marco:** To work. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** Mal? 

**Marco:** I guess mal maybe comes from Latin or something… cause in Spanish we say "Mal", which is something evil or not good. 

**Erica:** Okay, so I think we can understand malfunction is… 

**Marco:** Not good working, right? Hehe. 

**Erica:** Hehe. Yeah, um… okay, more or less it's not working properly. 

**Marco:** It's not working properly… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Okay, well, why don't we listen to the dialogue and find out what isn't working properly. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so this copy machine is definitely not working properly. 

**Erica:** Hehe. A serious malfunction. 

**Marco:** A serious malfunction, I think the whole building exploded. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, very dramatic here at EnglishPod, but we have fun, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's take a look at some of the great language that we saw in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, three words for you here in language takeaway and we heard all of these in the dialogue. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** So, this guy needs to get a copy ASAP. 

**Marco:** ASAP. 

**Erica:** ASAP. 

**Marco:** Or A-S-A-P. 

**Erica:** Yes, meaning… 

**Marco:** As soon as possible. 

**Erica:** So, really really fast. 

**Marco:** Rally fast. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** This is a very very common phase. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** So, it's an acronym and you can say it like ASAP or… 

**Marco:** A-S-A-P. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Yeah, usually people say like that because it's too long I guess to say as soon as possible, so… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Hey, I need this document ASAP. 

**Erica:** Yes, a… 

**Marco:** Or A-S-A-P. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's look at our next word, a practical joke. 

**Erica:** Practical joke. 

**Marco:** Practical joke. 

**Erica:** Practical joke. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, a practical joke. I'm sure we have all played a practical joke on some of our friends, right? 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Basically what you do is you do something funny on purpose to someone. 

**Erica:** Yeah, um, but something crazy. 

**Marco:** Crazy, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, for example, um, when I was in university, ah, there was this guy in our… in our building. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And we took all of his bedroom furnitures, of his bed his desk, everything, and put it down on the football field. 

**Marco:** Nice. 

**Erica:** Yeah, that was a practical joke. 

**Marco:** Hehe. It is a very good and elaborate practical joke. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, so practical joke… do something crazy or funny to your friends. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, and now let's look at our last word, never mind. 

**Erica:** Never mind. 

**Marco:** Never mind. 

**Erica:** Never mind. 

**Marco:** Okay, so if you say never mind it means… 

**Erica:** Don't worry about it. 

**Marco:** Don't worry about it. 

**Erica:** Forget it. 

**Marco:** Forget it. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Never mind. 

**Erica:** Yeah. Yeah, this is a… you know, this is so common and I think it would be helpful to understand how it's used, so let's hear some examples. 

**Example One** 

> A: Someone stole my wallet! Oh, wait, never mind. Here it is. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Can you get some milk on your way home? Oh, never mind, we still have some. 

**Example Three** 

> C: The printer's broken? Never mind I'll do this later. 

**Marco:** Okay, great examples and I think… our language takeaway is clear. So, why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time and then we'll come back and talk about putting it together. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** In this dialogue there's some great language that can be used in many different patterns or many different ways, so… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** In today's "putting it together" we're gonna show you how to use three of these patterns. 

**Putting It Together** 

**Marco:** Okay, the first pattern that we can look at is out of tonner. 

**Erica:** Out of tonner. 

**Marco:** Right, so, we've already talked about tonner. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Let's talk about "out of". 

**Erica:** Okay, so when you're out of, you… you have none. 

**Marco:** Right, so let's change a little bit, so I can say, I'm out of milk. 

**Erica:** Aha, um, I'm out of time. 

**Marco:** Out of time, right? 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Ah, if you're driving, I'm out of gas. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Or gasoline. 

**Erica:** Yep. So, Out of + noun. 

**Marco:** Uhu, perfect. It means you don't have none… you don't have none… 

**Erica:** Hehe. englishpod.com. 

**Marco:** EnglishPod.com… you ain't got none. 

**Erica:** Eubonics.com 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, out of time. Let's take a look at our second one, on your way up. 

**Erica:** Yeah, on your way up. 

**Marco:** On your way, right? 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, this is a great way when you're talking to someone and you're going to somewhere. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Right? So, on your way up… 

**Erica:** Can you bring this to HR. [NOTE: HR = Human Resources] 

**Marco:** Okay, on your way to the store… 

**Erica:** Can you mail this letter. 

**Marco:** Uhu, or maybe on your way home… 

**Erica:** Can you buy me some flowers. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Nice, alright, so on your way, it means… 

**Erica:** It means while you re going there. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Taking advantage of the fact that you're going somewhere. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, now let's take a look at our last one and this is a really great phrase. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Break down. 

**Erica:** Break down. 

**Marco:** In our dialogue we heard breaking down. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** The every thing in the office seems to be breaking down. 

**Marco:** Right, so when something breaks down… 

**Erica:** It stops working 

**Marco:** It stops working… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Exactly. So we can change it a little bit. What happens if we say break up? 

**Erica:** Ooh, boyfriend and girlfriend. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** They end their relationship. 

**Marco:** Okay, so there… we can maybe think about it as their relationship stops working. 

**Erica:** Oh, nice one. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. What about break in? 

**Erica:** Hum, enter a place using force. 

**Marco:** Right, you… you enter a house that's not yours. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so if you break in to a house maybe you break the window and climb in. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** What about brake out? 

**Erica:** The opposite. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So, for example, you might break out of jail. 

**Marco:** Break out of prison, uhu? 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** So, this is a great phrase you can change the… you can change the last word from break down, break up, break in… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And it means different things. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so use different prepositions for different meanings. 

**Marco:** Perfect. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then Erica and I will be back and talk a little bit more about malfunctioning office supplies. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, Erica, everything that you touch that's electronic seems to malfunction, right? 

**Erica:** This is absolutely true. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** I don't know what it is, but you know what, if… if I turn on a computer it will suddenly get a virus. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** And then… even if I'm very careful it still breaks. 

**Marco:** Right. Yeah, it happens sometimes I can relate to that, um… 

**Erica:** But you are much, um, better at computers and technology than I am. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, I really really like them and, well, I guess even I know a little bit about copy machines or copiers. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Because my uncles are… like copy technicians. 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** Yeah, so, um, you know, they fix copiers that broke down. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or they replace tonner and, ah, you know, they… they do all that stuff, so that's why I know a little bit about it. But actually the original term is the Xerox machine. 

**Erica:** Yes, why is that? 

**Marco:** From the brand, right? 

**Erica:** Ah, right. 

**Marco:** There's a brand called Xerox. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And a Xerox invented and patented this technology of making copies. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, the next time my photocopier explodes I'll call you. 

**Marco:** You call… call my uncles, right? 

**Erica:** Okay. Hehe. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, and, well, let us know how things in your office break down or if you have any stories of like Erica that breaks everything she touches. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's true.
