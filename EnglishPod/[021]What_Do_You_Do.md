## What Do You Do

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners and welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you a great intermediate lesson with some really useful vocabulary. 

**Erica:** Some vocabulary you can use to describe your job. 

**Marco:** Yes, this is a really common situation when you… someone asks you what you do and you have to tell them. 

**Erica:** Exactly, so, today's lesson is all about that. 

**Marco:** So, before we jump into our dialogue, let's start with our "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** We have two simple phrases today that you'll hear in our dialogue for our vocabulary preview. The first one is VP. 

**Marco:** VP. 

**Erica:** VP. 

**Marco:** So, the VP of a company is… 

**Erica:** The Vice-President. 

**Marco:** The Vice-President, exactly. 

**Erica:** Yeah, simple little acronym. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** And the next word is Fortune 500 (five hundred) company. 

**Marco:** Fortune Five 500 company. 

**Erica:** Fortune Five 500 company. 

**Marco:** So, a Fortune 500 company is… 

**Erica:** I'll let you explain. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, Fortune Magazine ranks the five hundred biggest companies in the U.S. 

**Erica:** So, a Fortune 500 company basically is… 

**Marco:** One of the five hundred biggest companies in the U.S. 

**Erica:** Okay, that's simple. 

**Marco:** Yep. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, with those words it sounds like we're going to be talking to some important people today. 

**Marco:** Yes, we are gonna be talking to some important people, so, let's listen to our dialogue for the first time. Now, it's gonna be a little bit fast, but you don't have to worry about it. 

**Erica:** Cause we'll come back and explain all of the important vocabulary. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, great music for our dialogue again, ha? 

**Erica:** Chosen by… 

**Marco:** By moi. Hehe. 

**Erica:** Of course. 

**Marco:** Yeah, Top Gun is one of my old time favorite movies and Top Gun pilot, what a cool profession? 

**Erica:** An excellent profession, much cooler than being like a VP. 

**Marco:** A VP. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** How boring is it? 

**Erica:** Yeah, anyway, this guy was a bit of a jerk, don't you think? 

**Marco:** Yeah, you can tell a little bit of, uh, the sarcastic tone he had in his voice. 

**Erica:** Definitely, but he did use some interesting phrases and we can talk about those now. 

**Marco:** Right, so, let's take a look at "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Our first word for language takeaway is implement. 

**Marco:** Implement. 

**Erica:** Implement. 

**Marco:** Implement. 

**Erica:** Let's listen to some examples of this word to help us understand its meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: Our company has to implement this sales strategy. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Sarah will be responsible for implementing the plan. 

**Example Three** 

> C: I implemented several new policies. 

**Marco:** Okay, great examples, and just in case to implement means to… 

**Erica:** Put into action 

**Marco:** To put into action, great. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Our second word for language takeaway – policies. 

**Erica:** Policies. 

**Marco:** Policies. 

**Erica:** Policies. 

**Marco:** So, policies are basically rules and regulations. 

**Erica:** Exactly, formal rules. 

**Marco:** For a company or an organization. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Policies, great. 

**Erica:** Third word… 

**Marco:** Oversee. 

**Erica:** Oversee. 

**Marco:** Oversee. 

**Erica:** Oversee. 

**Marco:** So, when you oversee operations, it means… 

**Erica:** Like you watch it to make sure it's okay. 

**Marco:** You supervise it. 

**Erica:** This is an excellent word to use when you wanna talk about your job responsibilities. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Oversee. 

**Marco:** Uhu, great. And our last word for language takeaway. It's kind of tricky, so, let's listen to how it was used in our dialogue. Example: That alone means I have fifteen hundred employees under me. Hehe. That alone means I have fifteen hundred employees under me. Hehe. 

**Erica:** So, this guy has fifteen hundred (1500) employees under him meaning he supervises fifteen hundred employees. 

**Marco:** Right, he manages fifteen hundred employees. 

**Erica:** He must be a busy man. 

**Marco:** Yes! For fifteen hundred employees… How many employees do you have under you, Erica? 

**Erica:** Uh, two. 

**Marco:** Yeah, not quite as much as fifteen hundred. 

**Erica:** Yeah, because I'm not a VP ???… for yet, hey? 

**Marco:** Hehe. Not yet, but you will. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, with this in mind, we are ready to listen to our dialogue for a second time and this time it's gonna be slower. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Okay, great stuff! With this, now we can start with our "fluency builder" for today. 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** We heard some excellent phrases in this dialogue, some phrases that sound really natural, hey? 

**Marco:** Yes! Especially the first one that we have today is… Whenever someone talks and talks and talks and just… and continuously talks without stopping, you would say… 

> Phrase 1: She's always going on about him at the office. She's always going on about him at the office. 

**Erica:** This is a really natural way of saying "keeps talking about". 

**Marco:** Right, keeps talking about him. 

**Erica:** Yep, so, we have a few examples of how this phrase works. Let's listen. 

**Example One** 

> A: My boss is always going on about how we need to save money; it's all he talks about. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Gary is always going on about his kids; he's always talking about how smart they are. 

**Example Three** 

> C: My mom is always going on about how I should get married. 

**Marco:** Okay, excellent! It's clear now. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, let's move on to our second phrase for today and this is a great one to use whenever you meet someone for the first time. 

**Erica:** Or when you start to talk to someone for the first time. 

**Marco:** Great. 

> Phrase 2: Hey, how's it going? Hello. Hey, how's it going? Hello. 

**Erica:** So, this is a really relaxed and natural way of saying "How are you". 

**Marco:** How are you? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, yeah, you can just say "Hey, how's it going?" 

**Erica:** Yep! 

**Marco:** Great. 

**Erica:** Really natural sounding. 

**Marco:** Now, our third phrase is the most important one of our dialogue. 

**Erica:** Yes! 

**Marco:** And it's a really common situation. 

**Erica:** When someone asks you about your job, they might say this. 

> Phrase 3: Arthur, what do you do for a living? Arthur, what do you do for a living? 

**Marco:** So, this is a really great way of asking "What work do you do?" or "What is your job?" 

**Erica:** Yes, and now… I know a lot of students sometimes say "What is your job?" 

**Marco:** Yeah, and that is… well, it's kind of correct, but not really. 

**Erica:** It doesn't sound very natural. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So, you wanna use "What do you do?" or… 

**Marco:** "What do you do for a living?" 

**Erica:** Sounds great. 

**Marco:** That's the way you ask someone what is their job. 

**Erica:** And that's how you sound supper natural. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, so, we're ready now to listen to our dialogue a last time and now you are ready to understand everything. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I have a little challenge for our listeners today. I have… 

**Erica:** What is it? 

**Marco:** Two challenges, actually. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** The first one – who performs the song that you heard and what is the song called? 

**Erica:** Okay, I don't know the answer, so, I'm looking forward to seeing what users do. 

**Marco:** And the second one is what is the number one company in the Fortune 500? 

**Erica:** Oh, I also don't know this answer. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Two great questions, so, I expect to see your answers on the comments page, but also we want to know about your profession. 

**Erica:** Yes! Tell us about your job, tell us what you do and use some of the great phrases you learned today to describe your answer. 

**Marco:** Great! So, we hope to see you there, but we're out of time now. So, we'll see everyone at englishpod.com, leave all your questions and, of course, all the comments. 

**Erica:** And Marco and I are always around to answer your questions.
