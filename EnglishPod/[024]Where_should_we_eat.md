## Where should we eat

---

**Marco:** Hello everyone! Welcome back to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're going out to eat. 

**Erica:** Yes! Good thing to, because I'm hungry. 

**Marco:** I know it's almost lunchtime. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, today we're gonna be talking about eating at a restaurant and giving some great recommendations and suggestions. 

**Erica:** Yes! We have language for describing food, for describing restaurants, and for making suggestions. 

**Marco:** Great! So, let's start with our "vocabulary preview" for this lesson. 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** We have two words today from our dialogue which you'll need to know to understand the dialogue. 

**Marco:** Great! The first one that we have today is food poisoning. 

**Erica:** Food poisoning. 

**Marco:** Food poisoning. 

**Erica:** Food poisoning. 

**Marco:** So, food poisoning is… 

**Erica:** Not a good thing. 

**Marco:** Not a good thing. 

**Erica:** It is when you eat some bad food and that food makes you sick. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** So, you get food poisoning. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, food poisoning, yeah, not a god thing. 

**Erica:** Okay, the next word. 

**Marco:** Allergic. 

**Erica:** Allergic. 

**Marco:** Allergic. 

**Erica:** Allergic. 

**Marco:** So, when you're allergic to something… 

**Erica:** Um, it makes you sick… that one thing makes you sick. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** For example, I'm allergic to seafood. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** If I eat seafood, I cannot breath. 

**Marco:** Oh, okay, so, you definitely wanna stay away from fish. 

**Erica:** Yes, yes. 

**Marco:** Some people are allergic to nuts like peanuts or… 

**Erica:** Or maybe milk. 

**Marco:** Milk. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Cool. 

**Erica:** So, when one type of food makes you sick, you are allergic to that food. 

**Marco:** Okay, great, so, with this in mind, now we can listen to our dialogue for the first time at its normal speed, but don't worry if you don't get everything now, because… 

**Erica:** We'll come back and teach you the important language. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

> A: Do you two have any plans for the evening?

> B: We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neigbourhood. Do you have any suggestions?

> A: I know this really nice Italian place. The food is fantastic, and the d′ecor is beautiful. I'd recommend giving it a try.

> C: Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food; I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

> A: In that case, I know a great little bistro. They make a really tasty seafood platter; the fish is outstanding.

> B: It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so. . .

> A: Okay, well, let me think. . . Oh, I know this great little place. It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches. You gotta give them a try.

> C: Ella, you took me there last time I visited, and I got food poisoning, remember?

**Erica:** Well, I'm getting hungry just thinking about all of those great restaurants. 

**Marco:** Yeah, some really good recommendations… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Except for food poisoning, right? 

**Erica:** No, not so good. 

**Marco:** Let's start with our "language takeaway" for this lesson. 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Our first word on language takeaway is check out. 

**Erica:** Check out. 

**Marco:** Check out. 

**Erica:** Check out. 

**Marco:** So, we have some great examples on how we can use check out in different situations and then you can understand the meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: Have you been to the new café next door? 

> B: Yeah, I checked it out yesterday. The food was great! 

**Example Two** 

> C: Hey, check out my new car. 

**Example Three** 

> D: I'm going to check out the new shopping mall this weekend. 

**Erica:** So, I can understand that it just means "look at". 

**Marco:** Yeah, "look at" or yeah… or "go see" as well… Let's go check out that new bar in town. 

**Erica:** Yeah, okay. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Cool! Next word is bistro. 

**Marco:** Bistro. 

**Erica:** Bistro. 

**Marco:** Bistro. 

**Erica:** So, what's a bistro? 

**Marco:** It's kind of complicated, but it's like a small restaurant that's not really cheap though. 

**Erica:** Not so cheap and not so expensive. 

**Marco:** Aha. And, um, it's usually French. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So, yes. 

**Erica:** Yeah, small informal restaurant. 

**Marco:** Yeah, bistro. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, our third phrase for today is not all that crazy about. 

**Erica:** Not all that crazy about. 

**Marco:** I'm not all that crazy about. 

**Erica:** Okay, again, kind of a funny phrase, but we've got some examples that will help you understand the meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: Do you want to go shopping with me tomorrow? 

> B: I'm not all that crazy about shopping. I don't like spending money. 

**Example Two** 

> C: I'm not crazy about jazz music. Can I change the song? 

**Marco:** So, this is just a really polite way of saying you don't like something. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** But now the opposite of this would be tasty. 

**Erica:** Tasty. 

**Marco:** That's our forth word – tasty. 

**Erica:** Tasty. 

**Marco:** So, when something is tasty… 

**Erica:** It's good. 

**Marco:** It's good. 

**Erica:** Like delicious. 

**Marco:** Delicious. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you know what, in English we almost never say "the food is delicious", but we always say… 

**Marco:** It's really tasty. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** This is really tasty. 

**Erica:** Yes, okay. 

**Marco:** Tasty. And our last phrase for language takeaway – in the mood for. 

**Erica:** In the mood for. 

**Marco:** In the mood for. 

**Erica:** Let's listen to some examples of this phrase and we'll understand the meaning a little bit better. 

**Example One** 

> A: We always eat hamburgers for dinner. I'm in the mood for something different. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Let's watch movie. How about Texas Chainsaw Massacre? 

> C: I am not in the mood for a horror movie. 

**Marco:** So, if I'm in the mood for something, I feel like doing or eating or… 

**Erica:** Watching or… 

**Marco:** Watching. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it means you wanna do that now. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I'm in the mood for. 

**Erica:** Okay, some great language we just looked at and I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

> A: Do you two have any plans for the evening?

> B: We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neigbourhood. Do you have any suggestions?

> A: I know this really nice Italian place. The food is fantastic, and the d′ecor is beautiful. I'd recommend giving it a try.

> C: Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food; I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

> A: In that case, I know a great little bistro. They make a really tasty seafood platter; the fish is outstanding.

> B: It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so. . .

> A: Okay, well, let me think. . . Oh, I know this great little place. It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches. You gotta give them a try.

> C: Ella, you took me there last time I visited, and I got food poisoning, remember?

**Marco:** Okay, some really great and useful phrases there and I know you wanna talk about specifically some of these phrases. 

**Erica:** Yes! Today's lesson is all about making recommendations, right? 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So, let's look at some useful phrases in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** So, in the dialogue we heard a great way of asking for a suggestion. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** Let's listen. 

> Phrase 1: Do you have any suggestions? Do you have any suggestions? 

**Marco:** So, that's how you would ask for a suggestion or you can say something else like "do you have any ideas?" 

**Erica:** Yeah, or you might say "do you have any thoughts?" 

**Marco:** Uhu. Okay, so, that's… 

**Erica:** Three great ways. 

**Marco:** Asking for suggestions. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** In response to this you can say something like this. 

> Phrase 2: I'd recommend giving it a try. I'd recommend giving it a try. 

**Erica:** We also heard another phrase that we use for giving suggestions. 

> Phrase 3: You gotta give them a try. You've got to give them a try. 

**Marco:** So, these two phrases are great - I'd recommend or you gotta give them a try. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Great ways of suggesting. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Now, what's really important here is the pronunciation of these words, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, you'll notice that we don't say I would recommend. 

**Marco:** Right, we use the contraction - I'd. 

**Erica:** I'd. 

**Marco:** I'd. 

**Erica:** I'd recommend. 

**Marco:** I'd recommend. 

**Erica:** Similarly, in the phrase you have got to we shorten that… 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** To say… 

**Marco:** You gotta. 

**Erica:** You gotta. 

**Marco:** You gotta give them a try. 

**Erica:** You gotta. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** You know what, guys? If you can shorten your phrases like this, if you can push the sounds together, you'll sound a lot more natural, hey? 

**Marco:** And also you'll be able to understand, because in movies or in shows they will never say "you have got to give them a try". 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Marco:** So, if you know how to use this form, you'll understand what they mean. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, great. 

**Erica:** Well, why don't we listen to the dialogue a third time? And you'll hear some of these contractions in the dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

> A: Do you two have any plans for the evening?

> B: We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neigbourhood. Do you have any suggestions?

> A: I know this really nice Italian place. The food is fantastic, and the d′ecor is beautiful. I'd recommend giving it a try.

> C: Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food; I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

> A: In that case, I know a great little bistro. They make a really tasty seafood platter; the fish is outstanding.

> B: It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so. . .

> A: Okay, well, let me think. . . Oh, I know this great little place. It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches. You gotta give them a try.

> C: Ella, you took me there last time I visited, and I got food poisoning, remember?

**Marco:** Okay, great dialogue and Erica, I know that you have some food poisoning stories for us. 

**Erica:** I don't know about stories, but I've definitely had food poisoning before, um… 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** One of the worst times that I ever had food poisoning was, uh, when I was traveling in Morocco. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** I had some really amazing orange juice, really fresh, squeezed that day in the morning. Um, and then I got on a bus. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** I think you can see where this is going, hey? 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so I was on the bus and then I started to feel really sick, um, and I was just hoping and hoping and hoping that the bus ride would be over soon. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** But unfortunately it wasn't. 

**Marco:** Oh, no. 

**Erica:** All I can say is that… I was sick and it wa… All I can say is that I was pretty sick and really, really unhappy. 

**Marco:** Yeah, I bet. Well, that's very strange that you got sick form, uh, orange juice, ha? 

**Erica:** Well, yeah, ma… maybe it was with some dirty water or something like that… 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** I don't know. It was just… It was a terrible situation. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's always complicated when you're travelling to other countries, it could be the water, it could be the… the way they prepare things, so… 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah, well… 

**Marco:** Food poisoning. 

**Erica:** Guys, I hope that you don't get food poisoning. 

**Marco:** Hehe. And if you have any food poisoning stories, that would be great for you to share them. 

**Erica:** Yes, at our website englishpod.com. 

**Marco:** And we'll see you there to answer all your questions and comments, but now we have to go. 

**Erica:** Okay, guys, thanks for listening. 

**Marco:** We'll see you there. 

**Erica:** Bye-bye! 

**Marco:** Bye!
