## Which finger

---

**Marco:** Hello everyone! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we are at a wedding ceremony. 

**Erica:** Alright, nice. 

**Marco:** Another nice wedding. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But, of course, it wouldn't be EnglishPod, unless we have something unexpected happening at this wedding. Okay, so we're gonna be talking about hands. 

**Erica:** Oh… but, Marco, what is there to say about a hand? 

**Marco:** Well, as you may or may not know each finger has a name on your hand. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, we're gonna learn how… w… so, we're gonna learn what those names are in English. 

**Erica:** Perfect. And also we're gonna learn about some common phrases, that you might hear in an English wedding. 

**Marco:** Exactly, because, I think… Exactly, because usually it's old English… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Maybe English that's not used anymore. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, I'm excited to find out what this unexpected event is, so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, embarrassing moment for the groom, right? 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Confusing the fingers in front of all his friends and family, not good. So, I mentioned before that we're gonna learn the names of each finger in your hand, so let's get started, let's take a look at these in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, well, why don't we start with the smallest finger… 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** On your hand. 

**Marco:** The smallest finger on your hand. That's called the… 

**Erica:** Pinkie. 

**Marco:** Pinkie. 

**Erica:** Pinkie. 

**Marco:** Sometimes people call it the little finger. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** So, a pinkie. And the next finger. 

**Erica:** Is the one the groom couldn't find. 

**Marco:** Okay, the ring finger. 

**Erica:** The ring finger. 

**Marco:** So, this is, of course, like the name says, where the wedding ring is usually placed… 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** On this finger. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Now, the next one is a controversial finger. 

**Erica:** That must be the middle finger. 

**Marco:** Okay, easy, middle finger. So, why is it controversial? 

**Erica:** Well, you know, if you put your middle finger up… And you put all… 

**Marco:** Hehe. Like you're doing right now to me? 

**Erica:** Hehe. Yes. I'm sorry, Marco, I'll do it this way. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** And all other fingers down… 

**Marco:** Aha. 

**Erica:** You are making a very rude gesture. 

**Marco:** It's a rude… 

**Erica:** Rude sign. 

**Marco:** So, ho… what would you call that? 

**Erica:** I would call that giving the middle finger. 

**Marco:** Giving the middle finger or… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I've also heard the phrase - flip someone off. 

**Erica:** Yes, or also flip the bird. 

**Marco:** Flip the bird… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or give him the bird. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** So, all phrases that you can use, when you are showing only your middle finger… 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** To somebody. 

**Marco:** It's not very polite. 

**Erica:** No, don't do it. 

**Marco:** Don't do it. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or unless somebody deserves it, I guess. Hehe. 

**Erica:** Well… 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** We won't talk about that, but what we will talk about is the next finger. 

**Marco:** The index finger. 

**Erica:** The index finger. 

**Marco:** Index finger. 

**Erica:** So, this is the finger you use to point. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** The index finger… Any idea why they call it the index finger? 

**Erica:** Cause when you're looking through the index of a book, you always use this finger. 

**Marco:** Right, I… I think you also use this finger to pass pages on a book, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. Okay, don't believe anything I just told here. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, we're not sure maybe you guys know the real answer to this. 

**Erica:** Alright. 

**Marco:** And our last finger, the most important one… 

**Erica:** The thumb. 

**Marco:** Thumb. 

**Erica:** T-H-U-M-B. 

**Marco:** The thumb. 

**Erica:** Thumb. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that's the short but fat finger… on your hand. 

**Erica:** That… the very moveable one. 

**Marco:** The moveable one. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** The one that you use to play… Playstation… and all that stuff. 

**Erica:** Video games. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** Okay, so the pronunciation here. Do you say the B at the end of this word? 

**Marco:** No, I wou… actually only pronounce the M. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** The thuM. 

**Erica:** The thuM. 

**Marco:** Yeah, I… you wouldn't say the thumB. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** Uhu. Okay, so, now that we're clear on all five fingers, let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and talk about these difficult phrases that the priest used. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Well, this is really common wedding speak, isn't it? 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's really common. That's what usually the priest or the person, who is marring somebody, would say. 

**Erica:** Why don't we look it some of these phrases now, because it's really interesting to talk about their meaning. So, the first one – may this ring be blessed. 

**Marco:** May this ring be blessed. 

**Erica:** May this ring be blessed. 

**Marco:** So, what does it mean when you bless something or someone? 

**Erica:** Well, usually, the… the religious leader does this, right? 

**Marco:** Aha. 

**Erica:** And he's giving good wishes to that thing. 

**Marco:** Could be for an object or to a person, right? 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** You can be blessed as well. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and so these good wishes usually come from God. 

**Marco:** Okay. Great, so, what about our next phrase? 

**Erica:** Abide in peace. 

**Marco:** Abide in peace. 

**Erica:** Abide in peace. 

**Marco:** Wow, so, this verb - abide. 

**Erica:** It means to live. 

**Marco:** To live. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** To… 

**Erica:** To be. 

**Marco:** To be in peace. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But it's very fancy and I don't know if you use it anymore. 

**Erica:** No, I think, you would… you would never use this word in conversation or even very rarely in writing. It's… it's quite old. 

**Marco:** Yes, definitely I would agree. So, abide in peace. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, what about our next phrase? I like this and it's the common phrase you'll hear in all movies and in all marriages. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** With this ring I thee wed. 

**Erica:** With this ring I thee wed. 

**Marco:** With this ring I thee wed. 

**Erica:** Okay, we've got two words in here that are also older English words, so… Thee. 

**Marco:** Thee. 

**Erica:** T-H… 

**Marco:** E-E. 

**Erica:** T-H-E-E. 

**Marco:** Thee. 

**Erica:** So, this is an… this is a Middle-English term for "you". 

**Marco:** You, right? 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So… I would s… can I say "I love thee"? 

**Erica:** You could, that would be very romantic. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** That also inappropriate for the office. 

**Marco:** Hehe. But… it's very old and… I guess you would… if you're reading Shakespeare you would definitely… 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

**Marco:** Come upon this, right? 

**Erica:** Yes, yes. 

**Marco:** And what about wed? 

**Erica:** This is also an old word for… an old verb for the action of marring someone. 

**Marco:** So, I can say "we will be wed next year". 

**Erica:** Hm… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** But… don't say that now, because you'll sound quite silly. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Yeah. 

**Erica:** It's too old-fashioned. 

**Marco:** Yeah, I guess so. But it's good to know, if… especially if you guys are reading something… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** A little bit more classical. 

**Erica:** Or you plan to get married to an English person. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, and our last phrase – wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment. 

**Erica:** Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment. 

**Marco:** So, now, he's referring to the rings, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Wear the ring… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** As a symbol. 

**Erica:** A sign. 

**Marco:** A representation… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Of love and commitment. So, why would you wear a ring as a… as a symbol of something? 

**Erica:** Well, obviously, you know, love, you can't see it, you can't touch it… 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So… so, you need something to show you that it's there. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** So, you need a sign of that love. 

**Marco:** Something that you can see. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, that's what the ring represents. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but how about this word commitment? 

**Marco:** A commitment is a strong promise. So, you promise to love that person, to take care of them… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Et cetera. 

**Erica:** Yeah, okay, great. So now, we're a little bit more familiar with some of the language you hear in a wedding ceremony and we also know all of the names of the fingers. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** So, why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time to hear these all in context? 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, now, it's perfectly clear. And, uh… a romantic dialogue in the end. 

**Erica:** Yeah, very romantic. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Although, a little bit embarrassing. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, what about wedding rings? Now, we have different types of rings, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** We have the wedding ring, the one they… that we just heard. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But we also have an engagement ring. 

**Erica:** Yes, yeah. In most English-speaking countries the women is very, very lucky… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Because she gets two rings. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So, when the man asks her to marry him… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** He gives her a diamond. 

**Marco:** A diamond ring. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** That is usually… that's the engagement ring. 

**Erica:** Uh, and it's really, really important, that he does this. 

**Marco:** Well… 

**Erica:** And it's also really important, that he spends a lot of money on the di… on the diamond. 

**Marco:** Yeah, I know about this. Diamonds are forever, right? 

**Erica:** An… And the tradition is you must spend at least one month's salary. 

**Marco:** Wow. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Is that it? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, the girl gets an… a diamond engagement ring… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And then on wedding day she gets the… the wedding ring. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And usually… will she wear both of them? 

**Erica:** Yeah, she'll always wear both of them. So tha… engagement ring glose… goes closest to you and then the wedding ring on top. 

**Marco:** And the engagement ring, it represents… 

**Erica:** The commitment to marry her… 

**Marco:** So… 

**Erica:** No, wait… the commitment from the man to marry her. 

**Marco:** Okay, so that… it's a symbol that they will get married. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's a symbol of the promise. 

**Marco:** Hm. Now, what happens if they break up and, uh, and they don't get married? Does he get the ring back? 

**Erica:** I don't know, um, okay, here's the rule. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** If he was a jerk… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** And… 

**Erica:** But… but if… if it was sort of like a happy break up, then okay. 

**Marco:** Okay. I guess it's a big risk, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, so, that's all for today guys, let us know if you guys have any interesting wedding stories and all that… Sometimes weddings can be embarrassing, people… I don't know… objecting, maybe… I've seen the groom faint. 

**Erica:** Or even fall in a pool.
