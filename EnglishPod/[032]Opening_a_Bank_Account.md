---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you another great lesson about being at the bank. 

**Erica:** That's right! We"ve got an Intermediate lesson for you today, um, with lots of great language to help you open a bank account. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, let's look at our "vocabulary preview" today. 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Two words today. The first one is checking account. 

_[NOTE: Canadian spelling - chequing account]_ 

**Marco:** A checking account. 

**Erica:** Checking account. 

**Marco:** So, what is a checking account? 

**Erica:** Well, it's a type of bank account that lets you do your day-to-day or daily banking. 

**Marco:** So, it's the normal bank account that you use to go shopping, that you… 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** That you use to pay your bills. 

**Erica:** Yeah, exactly. 

**Marco:** The opposite, and our second word, is… 

**Erica:** Savings account. 

**Marco:** Savings account. 

**Erica:** Savings account. 

**Marco:** So, a savings account is to… 

**Erica:** It's a bank account where you save your money. 

**Marco:** To save money, right? 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** So, usually, you don't touch the money at this account. 

**Erica:** Yeah, usually, it stays in there. 

**Marco:** Right, so, usually, banks will have these two types of accounts. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Checking and savings. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Okay, great! Let's listen to our dialogue a first time now. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, today we're at a bank and we're going to listen as a man is opening a bank account. 

**Marco:** The dialogue is gonna be spoken at a normal speed, so it might be a little bit fast. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But don't worry about it, because we'll come back and explain everything. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

> A: Next, please. May I help you, sir?

> B: Hello, yes, I'd like to open a bank account.

> A: Certainly, I can help you with that. What type of account would you like to open? A chequing or a savings account?

> B: What features do they offer?

> A: Well, if you just take a look here, see, with our chequing account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee, and our savings account has a higher interest rate, but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars.

> B: I see, well, I think I'm more interested in a chequing account; I like to have easy access to my money.

> A: Alright, then, with this chequing account you'll be issued a debit card and a cheque book. Will you require overdraft protection? There is an extra fee for that.

> B: No, that won't be necessary.

> A: In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork; I'll need your social insurance number, and two pieces of government ID. If you could just sign here, and here, and here; we'll be all set. Would you like to make a deposit today?

> B: Yes, I'd like to deposit one billion dollars.

**Marco:** Alright, one billion dollars. 

**Erica:** That's a lot of money! 

**Marco:** That's a weird laugh. 

**Erica:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, let's look at "language takeaway" today. 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Today we"ve got four words for you in language takeaway all about money and banking. 

**Marco:** Money and banking. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** The first one that we have today is transaction. 

**Erica:** Transaction. 

**Marco:** Transaction. 

**Erica:** A transaction. 

**Marco:** So, we have some great examples that will help you understand what a transaction is, so, let's listen. 

**Example One** 

> A: I need a record of my most recent paying transactions. 

**Example Two** 

> B: There's no fee for bank transactions done online. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Okay, we've deposited your money. Would you like to make another transaction today? 

**Erica:** So, basically, I can understand that a transaction is moving money around in your bank accounts. 

**Marco:** Right, it's taking your money from… right, it's taking money from your bank account and putting it in other account or just taking in it to spend… whatever. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** That's a transaction. 

**Erica:** Or even putting money in to your bank account… 

**Marco:** That's also a transaction. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Great! Our second word – balance. 

**Erica:** Balance. 

**Marco:** Balance. 

**Erica:** Balance. 

**Marco:** Your account balance… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Is how much money you have. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** An account balance. 

**Marco:** My account balance is two dollars right now, I think. 

**Erica:** That's a bit of a problem. 

**Marco:** Yes. 

**Erica:** Good thing payday is three days away. 

**Marco:** Yeah! Oh, my God! Okay, our third word – overdraft. 

**Erica:** Overdraft. 

**Marco:** Overdraft. 

**Erica:** Overdraft. 

**Marco:** So, this really comes in handy, right? 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** To overdraft… can you tell us a little bit about it? 

**Erica:** Let's say in my bank account I have five hundred dollars. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** But I spend six hundred dollars. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So, I have an overdraft in my account, meaning I owe the bank a hundred dollars. 

**Marco:** Right, it's also commonly refer to… as a negative balance. 

**Erica:** That's right! 

**Marco:** Right? Negative balance. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Like me. Very soon I will have a negative balance. 

**Erica:** Okay, I think this one is a little bit tricky to understand, so let's listen to a couple of examples of how we use this word. 

**Example One** 

> A: The maximum overdraft of my account is only five thousand dollars. 

**Example Two** 

> B: I'm sorry, sir, but you've exceeded your maximum overdraft limit. I cannot give you any more money. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Oh, no! I have to pay fifteen hundred dollars in overdraft fees. 

**Marco:** Okay, great examples! Now, we can take a look at our last word – debit card. 

**Erica:** Debit card. 

**Marco:** Debit card. 

**Erica:** D-E-B-I-T card, debit card. 

**Marco:** So, debit card is issued by the bank. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And used to… 

**Erica:** Take money out of a… ATM. 

**Marco:** From an ATM-machine, right? 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right, a debit card. Not to be confuse with a credit card. 

**Erica:** Not the same thing. 

**Marco:** Alright. Okay, great! So, now we could listen to our dialogue a second time at a slower speed, so, now we can… 

**Erica:** We can hear all of the great language we just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

> A: Next, please. May I help you, sir?

> B: Hello, yes, I'd like to open a bank account.

> A: Certainly, I can help you with that. What type of account would you like to open? A chequing or a savings account?

> B: What features do they offer?

> A: Well, if you just take a look here, see, with our chequing account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee, and our savings account has a higher interest rate, but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars.

> B: I see, well, I think I'm more interested in a chequing account; I like to have easy access to my money.

> A: Alright, then, with this chequing account you'll be issued a debit card and a cheque book. Will you require overdraft protection? There is an extra fee for that.

> B: No, that won't be necessary.

> A: In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork; I'll need your social insurance number, and two pieces of government ID. If you could just sign here, and here, and here; we'll be all set. Would you like to make a deposit today?

> B: Yes, I'd like to deposit one billion dollars.

**Marco:** We heard some interesting phrases of how to tell somebody to do something in a polite way. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So, let's start with "fluency builder" and explain these words. 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** The bank teller asked this man to do a number of things in order to open his bank account and she used some great expressions. 

**Marco:** Right, let's listen to how she asked the man to do some things in a polite way. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

> Phrase 1: I'll get you to fill out this paperwork. I'll get you to fill out this paperwork. 

> Phrase 2: I'll need your social insurance number. I'll need your social insurance number. 

> Phrase 3: If you could just sign here. If you could just sign here. 

**Marco:** So, the first thing she said is "I'll get you to fill out this paperwork". 

**Erica:** I'll get you to. 

**Marco:** Right? Right, I'll get you to. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, it's just a way of saying "can you please fill this out?" 

**Erica:** Yeah, do this. 

**Marco:** Do this. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But in a different way, right? 

**Erica:** Aha, more polite. 

**Marco:** It's pretty polite. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Then she also said "I'll need your social insurance number". 

**Erica:** I'll need your. 

**Marco:** I'll need your. Again, a polite way of saying… 

**Erica:** Give me… 

**Marco:** Give me. 

**Erica:** Your social insurance number. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Give me your social insurance… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And the last thing she said, and this is really polite, "if you could just sign here". 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** If you could just sign here. 

**Erica:** If you could just… 

**Marco:** If you could just wait a moment… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** I'll be with you. 

**Erica:** If you could just send an e-mail with your bank account number. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Very polite way of asking for something. 

**Erica:** Yep. Well, some great language in today's "cast… 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** Let's listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll catch all of this wonderful language. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

> A: Next, please. May I help you, sir?

> B: Hello, yes, I'd like to open a bank account.

> A: Certainly, I can help you with that. What type of account would you like to open? A chequing or a savings account?

> B: What features do they offer?

> A: Well, if you just take a look here, see, with our chequing account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee, and our savings account has a higher interest rate, but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars.

> B: I see, well, I think I'm more interested in a chequing account; I like to have easy access to my money.

> A: Alright, then, with this chequing account you'll be issued a debit card and a cheque book. Will you require overdraft protection? There is an extra fee for that.

> B: No, that won't be necessary.

> A: In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork; I'll need your social insurance number, and two pieces of government ID. If you could just sign here, and here, and here; we'll be all set. Would you like to make a deposit today?

> B: Yes, I'd like to deposit one billion dollars.

**Marco:** Okay, so, an interesting thing here: not many countries use checks. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** Right? The checkbook or a check. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it tends to be more of an American thing. Don't you think? 

**Marco:** It is, it is, I think, it is. For those of you who aren't sure what a check is, it's basically a piece of paper that you just sing your name and… 

**Erica:** Yeah, you write the amount of money and then you sing your name, right? 

**Marco:** Right, and then you give that to the person that… that person can take it to the bank and get money in exchange for it. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** It's not very common in other countries. 

**Erica:** No, but from what I know, every single American has a checkbook and uses it… 

**Marco:** Right… 

**Erica:** Pretty regularly. 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** For example, you"d pay your, uh, phone bill… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or your electric bill use… put a check in the mailbox and… it's paid. 

**Erica:** And it's done. 

**Marco:** It's an interesting thing. Also sometimes in other countries people salaries are paid through checks. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Paycheck. 

**Erica:** Oh, yes! 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** I see where that word comes from. 

**Marco:** Paycheck. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** But, for example, here in China it's not very common, right? 

**Erica:** U-u. 

**Marco:** I"ve never seen a check here. 

**Erica:** Me neither. 

**Marco:** What about in your countries? We"d like to know how the banking system works.
