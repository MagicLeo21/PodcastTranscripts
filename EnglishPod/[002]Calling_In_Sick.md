## Calling In Sick

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco.

**Erica:** And I'm Erica.

**Marco:** And today we're gonna be bringing you a very useful lesson about being sick.

**Erica:** Yeah, um, we're going to learn, um, how to tell your boss that you can't go to work, because you're sick.

**Marco:** Exactly! This is really important, because we all get sick and sometimes you just can't go to work.

**Erica:** Yes! Or maybe sometimes you just don't want to go to work.

**Marco:** You just… exactly, maybe you're lying.

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** But we're gonna be teaching you how to do it anyway, so, before we start with our dialogue, let's take a look at "vocabulary preview".

**Vocabulary Preview**

**Erica:** In this vocabulary preview we have two words for you. Uh, the first one is quite ill.

**Marco:** Quite ill.

**Erica:** Quite ill.

**Marco:** So, quite ill…

**Erica:** Very sick.

**Marco:** Very sick.

**Erica:** Uhu.

**Marco:** Quite is a synonym of very.

**Erica:** Exactly!

**Marco:** Okay.

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** And ill…

**Erica:** Sick.

**Marco:** Sick.

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** So, they both mean the same thing, no difference.

**Erica:** No difference at all. I just think, uh, ill is more common in British English.

**Marco:** Uh, exactly. Alright, let's take a look at our second word – flu.

**Erica:** The flu.

**Marco:** The flu.

**Erica:** The flu.

**Marco:** So, the flu is a virus.

**Erica:** Yeah, it's a sickness.

**Marco:** Okay, and, uh…

**Erica:** Uhu.

**Marco:** It's very similar to a cold.

**Erica:** Yes, but just a lot worse.

**Marco:** A lot worse, so, it's stronger.

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. Um, it's also called influenza.

**Marco:** Influenza.

**Erica:** Aha.

**Marco:** Exactly. So, the flu.

**Erica:** Uhu.

**Marco:** Okay, so, let's listen to our dialogue. What's gonna happen here today?

**Erica:** Well, we're going to listen as Julie calls her boss to tell him she's sick.

**Marco:** Alright, but is she really sick?

**Erica:** I don't know. Let's find out.

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME**

> A: Hello, Daniel speaking, how may I help you?

> B: Hi, Daniel, Julie here.

> A: Hi, Julie, how are you?

> B: Actually, I'm feeling quite ill today.

> A: I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong?

> B: I think I'm coming down with the flu. I have a headache, a sore throat a runny nose and I'm feeling slightly feverish.

> A: I see… so you're calling in sick?

> B: Yes, I was hoping to take the day offto recover.

> A: OK, then. Try and get some rest.

**Marco:** Alright, so, Julie didn't really seem to be sick, ha?

**Erica:** Yeah, I… I don't know th… that cough was just a little too much.

**Marco:** It seemed like she was acting.

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** Alright, so, let's take a look at some of this vocabulary in "language takeaway".

**Language Takeaway**

**Erica:** We have five words for you here and these are all great words to describe a sickness, right?

**Marco:** Uhu.

**Erica:** Alright, the first one – headache.

**Marco:** Headache.

**Erica:** Headache.

**Marco:** Headache.

**Erica:** So, when you have a headache, you have a sore head, right?

**Marco:** Right, your head hurts.

**Erica:** Uhu.

**Marco:** So, it's pretty simple.

**Erica:** Yep.

**Marco:** You have a headache.

**Erica:** It's the way you feel after, um, being at a bar too late.

**Marco:** Yeah…

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** When you drink too much…

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** You get a headache.

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** Alright, let's take a look at our next word – sore throat.

**Erica:** Sore throat.

**Marco:** Sore throat.

**Erica:** Sore throat.

**Marco:** So, basically, we have two words here, let's look at the first one – sore.

**Erica:** Hurting.

**Marco:** It hurts, right?

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** And your throat is…

**Erica:** Well, it… you know it's the part right here, at the back… oh, you can't see me.

_[Comment: Erica points at her throat, but realizes right away that we can't see her, because it's a podcast, not a videocast]_

**Marco:** Hehe.

**Erica:** Well, it's the part, um, at the back of your mouth that goes down to your stomach.

**Marco:** Alright, that's your throat.

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** So, you use your throat to swallow.

**Erica:** Uhu.

**Marco:** Okay. Now, we can use the word sore with different body parts, right?

**Erica:** Yeah, like, um, a sore back.

**Marco:** A sore back, right? Or maybe you were playing tennis all weekend, so you have a sore arm.

**Erica:** Aha, or even a sore neck.

**Marco:** Right.

**Erica:** Uhu.

**Marco:** So, the word sore. Let's take a look at our third word – running nose.

**Erica:** Running nose.

**Marco:** Running nose.

**Erica:** Running nose.

**Marco:** This is a very strange word.

**Erica:** I know.

**Marco:** But it doesn't mean that your nose is running, right?

**Erica:** No, but… okay, um, it… no, but when you have a running nose, um, there's lots of water coming out of your nose, right?

**Marco:** Right.

**Erica:** So, it's interesting though, because when you run, you go fast, right?

**Marco:** Hehe. So, a lot of water is…

**Erica:** Coming fast out of your nose.

**Marco:** Out of your nose. Running nose.

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** Okay, our forth word today – slightly feverish.

**Erica:** Slightly feverish.

**Marco:** Slightly feverish.

**Erica:** Slightly feverish.

**Marco:** So, again, slightly is…

**Erica:** A little bit.

**Marco:** A little bit…

**Erica:** Uhu.

**Marco:** Right? A little bit. And feverish?

**Erica:** Well, let's break this word down. Um, we know fever, right?

**Marco:** Uhu.

**Erica:** Um, so, when you're… when your body is very, very hot…

**Marco:** Right.

**Erica:** Because you're sick. So, feverish is the feeling or your body being very, very hot.

**Marco:** Uhu. Okay, so, you have a high temperature.

**Erica:** It's not that you have a high temperature, but you feel like you have a high temperature.

**Marco:** Okay, so, slightly feverish.

**Erica:** Uhu.

**Marco:** And our last word – to recover.

**Erica:** Recover.

**Marco:** Recover.

**Erica:** Recover.

**Marco:** So, this means to get better, right?

**Erica:** Exactly.

**Marco:** Can you only use it when you're sick?

**Erica:** So, when you recover, you get better and you rest, so, maybe you can say, um, "I was so busy this week, I need to recover at this weekend".

**Marco:** Okay, so, yeah, if you feel tired…

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** Or you feel sick, you can recover.

**Erica:** Uhu.

**Marco:** Okay, let's listen to our dialogue again and we can listen to these words that we've just talked about.

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME**

> A: Hello, Daniel speaking, how may I help you?

> B: Hi, Daniel, Julie here.

> A: Hi, Julie, how are you?

> B: Actually, I'm feeling quite ill today.

> A: I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong?

> B: I think I'm coming down with the flu. I have a headache, a sore throat a runny nose and I'm feeling slightly feverish.

> A: I see… so you're calling in sick?

> B: Yes, I was hoping to take the day offto recover.

> A: OK, then. Try and get some rest.

**Marco:** In this dialogue we listened to some really interesting phrases of how you can tell your boss that you're feeling sick, right?

**Erica:** Yeah, some great phrases, so, let's look at these in "fluency builder".

**Fluency Builder**

**Marco:** Okay, let's take a look at our first phrase on fluency builder – I'm coming down with.

**Erica:** I'm coming down with.

**Marco:** I'm coming down with.

**Erica:** I'm coming down with.

**Marco:** Alright, so, let's listen to some examples and then we'll come back and explain this interesting phrase.

**Example One**

> A: My throat really hurts. I think I'm coming down with a cold.

**Example Two**

> B: You have a running nose. Are you coming down with the flu?

**Example Three**

> C: I don't feel well. I think I'm coming down with something.

**Marco:** Okay, so, basically, coming down with means…

**Erica:** Starting to get sick.

**Marco:** Uh… um, beginning to feel sick.

**Erica:** Yes.

**Marco:** Okay, so, you can use it with "I'm coming down with the flu".

**Erica:** Aha, I'm coming down with a cold.

**Marco:** Uhu. Or I'm coming down with a cough.

**Erica:** Yeah, or I'm coming down with something.

**Marco:** With something, you don't what it is.

**Erica:** Exactly.

**Marco:** Okay, let's take a look at our second phrase – calling in sick.

**Erica:** Calling in sick.

**Marco:** Okay, calling in sick.

**Erica:** So, this phrase is great! You know, when you say "I'm calling in sick"…

**Marco:** Uhu.

**Erica:** You're saying "hey I'm not going to come to work today, because I'm sick".

**Marco:** Okay, so, literally, it means that you call your office…

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** And you say you're not going to work.

**Erica:** Yes, um, but it's great, cause it's three words that show such a long idea.

**Marco:** Right, because otherwise you would have to say "I'm calling, because I don't feel well, so, I'm not gonna go to work".

**Erica:** Yes!

**Marco:** But if you say "I'm calling in sick", everyone knows…

**Erica:** Everyone understands.

**Marco:** That you're not gonna go to work.

**Erica:** Yep.

**Marco:** Okay, now, let's take a look at our last phrase – take the day off.

**Erica:** Take the day off.

**Marco:** Take the day off.

**Erica:** Take the day off.

**Marco:** Now, this is a great phrase! To take the day off is to…

**Erica:** Not go to work.

**Marco:** On that day.

**Erica:** Yes!

**Marco:** Now, you can say "take the… week off".

**Erica:** Uhu, take the month off.

**Marco:** Take the month off or…

**Erica:** Yeah.

**Marco:** Take the year off.

**Erica:** Yeah, if you're so lucky.

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, so, take the day off means to not go to work on that day.

**Erica:** Uhu.

**Marco:** Alright, let's listen to our dialogue again now and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME**

> A: Hello, Daniel speaking, how may I help you?

> B: Hi, Daniel, Julie here.

> A: Hi, Julie, how are you?

> B: Actually, I'm feeling quite ill today.

> A: I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong?

> B: I think I'm coming down with the flu. I have a headache, a sore throat a runny nose and I'm feeling slightly feverish.

> A: I see… so you're calling in sick?

> B: Yes, I was hoping to take the day offto recover.

> A: OK, then. Try and get some rest.

**Erica:** Well, Marco, um, have you ever done what Julie did? Did you ever call your boss to say you're sick to… when you're not really?

**Marco:** Yeah, of course! I mean, sometimes you just don't feel very well, but you're not really sick, you just don't feel like going to work.

**Erica:** Yes.

**Marco:** Or sometimes you have something to do.

**Erica:** Uh.

**Marco:** Right?

**Erica:** Yep! You know what we call those in Canada? Um, we call them personal days.

**Marco:** Personal days.

**Erica:** Yeah! So, you say "oh, I'm gonna take a personal day"…

**Marco:** Ouh.

**Erica:** Meaning I'm gonna call in sick, but then go shopping.

**Marco:** Hehe. We used to do that a lot, because, for example, soccer games are such a big deal.

**Erica:** Oh, yeah!

**Marco:** And, you know, sometimes you would have, ah, a soccer match between, I don't know, Brazil… and it would be maybe at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m., so, everyone would call in sick on that day.

**Erica:** Yeah, so, the boss at least could plan that he would have an empty office.

**Marco:** Yeah, or sometimes you would take half the day off.

**Erica:** Uh.

**Marco:** So, you would just go… you say "well, I'm not gonna make it in the morning, but I'll come in the afternoon".

**Erica:** So, you would recover…

**Marco:** A l…

**Erica:** Very quickly.

**Marco:** Yeah, I'm feeling a little bit sick, but I'm going to be better in the afternoon.

**Erica:** Yeah.
