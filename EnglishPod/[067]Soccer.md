**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you another great lesson about sports, part of our sports series. 

**Erica:** That's right and in this lesson we are talking about maybe the world's most favorite sport. 

**Marco:** Right, one of the most popular sports in the world, soccer. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Or also known as football in other countries. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, before we get started with this great lesson, let's take a look at some of the words we'll find in the dialogue in "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** We're going to look at three words here. The first word is wingman. 

**Marco:** Wingman. 

**Erica:** A wingman. 

**Marco:** Now, wingman isn't really related to soccer in any way. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** But it's a way of referring to somebody as your "right hand". 

**Erica:** So, your helper. 

**Marco:** Your helper, your… your number one guy. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** So, a wingman is someone, who helps you a lot. 

**Marco:** Aha, exactly. 

**Erica:** Okay, our next word, tied. 

**Marco:** Tied. 

**Erica:** They're tied. 

**Marco:** They are tied. Now, this is an interesting word, because tie can be a noun, verb, and an adjective, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly, so, in this case "they are tied" it's an adjective meaning… 

**Marco:** They have the same score. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And a tie is… 

**Marco:** Is a game that has ended with no winner or loser. Both of them had the same score. 

**Erica:** Exactly, and so obviously the verb "to tie" is to reach the same score as your other team. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, our third word can also be used as a noun and a verb and it is foul. 

**Marco:** Fouled. 

**Erica:** Fouled. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, to foul somebody… 

**Erica:** Is to do something to them that is not allowed in this sport. 

**Marco:** Okay, and… so, when you do this, you have committed a foul. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you use it in the same way, to foul or a foul. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Interesting. 

**Erica:** Well, we're going to hear these three words in context now. So, why don't we listen to our soccer dialogue? 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, Ecuador tied with Brazil in the Two Thousand Twenty Two World Cup. 

**Erica:** Wow, Marco, I'm really happy to see that you are, ah… able to see so far in to the future. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, I called it, so… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** In 2022 if we do win the World Cup, you know who said it first. 

**Erica:** Alright, do you have money on that? 

**Marco:** Ah, yes. 

**Erica:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, so, apart from this we saw some really great vocabulary in this lesson, so let's take a look at it now in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, we've got a lot of soccer words for you, but they're all important. So, let's take a look at the first one, kick off. 

**Marco:** Kick off. 

**Erica:** Kick off. 

**Marco:** So, a kick off. 

**Erica:** This is how you start a soccer game, right? 

**Marco:** Right, so it's the very beginning, the referee blows the whistle and you kick the ball to another player. That's the kick off. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, our next phrase, out of bounds. 

**Marco:** Out of bounds. 

**Erica:** Out of bounds. 

**Marco:** Okay, out of bounds, this is a great word. 

**Erica:** Uhu. So, in soccer, when the ball goes out of bounds, it goes outside the white lines, right? 

**Marco:** Right, outside of the playing field. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** And you can use it in all other sports, you can use it in basketball, you can use it in, ah, tennis. 

**Erica:** Or football or anything. 

**Marco:** Right, so… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Any part that is not for playing. 

**Erica:** Out of bounds. 

**Marco:** What's our next word? 

**Erica:** Throw in. 

**Marco:** A throw in. 

**Erica:** A throw in. 

**Marco:** Okay, so a throw in. The ball goes out of bounds… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** How do you put it back in to play? 

**Erica:** Obviously, a throw in. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you throw in the ball. That's the only time where a soccer player will actually grab the ball with his hands. 

**Erica:** Alright, now, another soccer term we have here, offside. 

**Marco:** Offside. 

**Erica:** Offside. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, this is a little bit difficult to explain, but just imagine, you're on the soccer field… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** And you're trying to score a goal… 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Now, you have some defenders, right? 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** Those are the people who are trying to take the ball away. And you pass the ball to somebody who is behind the defenders. 

**Erica:** Oh, and that person is offside. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, you must be at all times in the same position as the defenders of in front of them, but you can't be all the way in the back. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, is this a noun or a verb or an adjective? 

**Marco:** So, this is an adjective, he is offside. That's his condition. 

**Erica:** Okay, great. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Excellent explanation, Marco, thank you. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** Now, we're going to look at three different phrases for three types of kicks in soccer. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, let's take a look at this. The first one is goal kick. 

**Erica:** A goal kick. 

**Marco:** Okay, goal kick. 

**Erica:** So, who does the goal kick? 

**Marco:** It's usually the goalie or the goalkeeper. 

**Erica:** Alright. 

**Marco:** Who… who takes the goal kick. 

**Erica:** Okay, so when the goalie kicks the ball. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Now, what about a corner kick? 

**Marco:** Okay, so, if the team is attacking. And the ball goes out of bounds… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** In the back area near the goal, then they get a corner kick. They gotta kick the ball from the corner of the field. 

**Erica:** This is a great chance to score a goal, isn't it? 

**Marco:** Exactly, yes. 

**Erica:** Okay, and our final kick, a penalty kick. 

**Marco:** Penalty kick. 

**Erica:** Penalty kick. 

**Marco:** So, if a player gets fouled, while he is in the area near the goal. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** He gets a penalty kick, so basically it's just him… I think it's thirteen or fifteen steps away from the goalie. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And he gets the opportunity to score or to kick the ball. 

**Erica:** So, there're no defenders or other players in the way. 

**Marco:** Nobody, uhu. 

**Erica:** Wow, another great chance to score a goal. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, these are all great soccer words. I think we should hear them again in context, so let's listen this time a little bit slower. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Alright, so, we heard these words that we were talking about in context and now some really interesting phrases came up and this would be a good time to take a look at them in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** Well, Marco, there're three great phrases in this dialogue that I wanna look at. Um, the first one "on the brink of". 

**Marco:** We are on the brink of. 

**Erica:** We're on the brink of soccer history. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, "on the brink of". What is… what exactly does that mean? 

**Erica:** Why don't we hear some examples to help us understand the meaning? 

**Example One** 

> A: Look, we don't have any money. We're on the brink of going bankrupt. 

**Example Two** 

> B: The two countries are on the brink of war. 

**Example Three** 

> C: We're on the brink of an important discovery. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, great examples "on the brink of", at a critical point. 

**Erica:** Exactly, it means you're almost there, right? 

**Marco:** Okay, yeah, very good. And what about this next phrase that I saw and it was really interesting. No question about it. 

**Erica:** No question about it. 

**Marco:** No question about it. 

**Erica:** No question about it. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, this is a statement, that doesn't really make much sense. Well, what am I saying, when I say "oh, no question about it"? 

**Erica:** You're saying "I agree", "there is no doubt", "you're right" 

**Marco:** You're right. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Well, let's give some examples. I could say "there's no question about it, Ecuador is a great soccer team". 

**Marco:** Ah, there is no question about that. 

**Erica:** Hehe. Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, or you can say "no question about it, our company makes the best products on the market". 

**Erica:** Okay, so, really useful phrase, that you can use in sports or anywhere else. 

**Marco:** Okay. And now let's take a look at our last phrase for fluency builder and it's a really good one to exaggerate a little bit. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** By a mile. 

**Erica:** By a mile. 

**Marco:** By a mile. 

**Erica:** So, he was offside by a mile. 

**Marco:** Right, so, the commentator is saying that he was very offside. 

**Erica:** That it was really obvious. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, you can use that also in different context, maybe not in sports. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, maybe we can say "our company is ahead of all the others by a mile". 

**Marco:** Right, or if you tell somebody to guess your age and they say "oh, I think you are forty two". 

**Erica:** Oh, you could say "you're off by a mile". 

**Marco:** Right, why? 

**Erica:** So you're really really wrong. 

**Marco:** Right, exactly. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, it's a way of exaggerating a little bit. 

**Erica:** Yes, and saying it's really obvious. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Uhu. Well, three awesome phrases and I think it will help us to hear them one more time. So, let's listen to the dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, well, as you all may know, soccer is a very popular sport especially in Latin America. 

**Erica:** That's right. And your favorite team, Ecuador. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Are they… Are they really this good in soccer, they're really gonna win the Twenty Twenty-two Cup? 

**Marco:** Well, maybe not. 

**Erica:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** Well, actually Ecuador has… has improved with time, but usually it's the strong teams like Argentina and Brazil, who, ah, dominate the region, right? 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** Um, but yeah, hopefully we'll make it next time. 

**Erica:** Okay, well, I have my money on Ecuador and… 

**Marco:** Hehe. For 2022. 

**Erica:** But, yeah, not on Canada. There's no hope for us. 

**Marco:** Well, Canada is doing really well now. They, actually… 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** Ah, beat Mexico, if I'm not mistaken. 

**Erica:** Oh, actually, that's sort of… yeah, I kind of remember that now. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** But, there's… I think there's no hope for us to beat Brazil or Argentina, one of these big countries. 

**Marco:** We have the next World Cup coming up, so it's really exciting and I don't know who's gonna win. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, um, listeners! Who do you think is going to win? Who is the best soccer team out there? 

**Marco:** Hehe. Right, there're really good soccer teams. Although, some of the… some countries aren't really known for their soccer like Russia. You don't really hear too much soccer from Russia. 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** Or from China is for that. 

**Erica:** I wonder how popular it is in these countries. 

**Marco:** Hum, so let us know, come to our website englishpod.com, tell us how popular soccer is in your country or what team you are a fan of. I know many people like the European Cups and they're fans of, ah… ah, Barcelona or the Italian teams. 

**Erica:** Well, come to the website. Marco and I are always around to answer your questions and until next time… Good bye! 

**Marco:** Bye!
