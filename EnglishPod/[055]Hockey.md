**Marco:** Hello everyone! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're gonna be bringing you another great sports lesson. 

**Erica:** Yes, this one is for all our hockey fans. 

**Marco:** I know we have a lot of listeners from Russia, so this is a very popular sport in Russia, Czech Republic… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So… 

**Erica:** And Canada. 

**Marco:** And Canada, right. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Very very popular in Canada. 

**Erica:** It's our national game. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, I guess cause you guys have so much ice. 

**Erica:** I know, there's nothing else to do. 

**Marco:** Skiing and hockey. 

**Erica:** Uh. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, it's gonna be a really fun lesson, we're gonna have a lot of great vocabulary, so… before we start in the dialogue let's take a look at "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** We have three words for you now, um, the first one really simple, puck. 

**Marco:** Puck. 

**Erica:** Puck. 

**Marco:** Puck. 

**Erica:** P-U-C-K. Puck. 

**Marco:** So, it's almost like duck. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** But with the P. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And this is actually kind of like the ball that you use in hockey. 

**Erica:** But it's not as ball. 

**Marco:** But it's not as ball. 

**Erica:** It's flat. 

**Marco:** It's flat. 

**Erica:** And round. 

**Marco:** And round. 

**Erica:** Uh. 

**Marco:** So. It looks like a disk. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Kind of like mini frisbie. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And this is what the players do, this is what they… 

**Erica:** They chase this around. 

**Marco:** They chase it, right. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So in basketball you have a ball, in soccer you have a ball, in hockey you have a puck. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, our next word… 

**Erica:** Key game. 

**Marco:** A key game. 

**Erica:** A key game. 

**Marco:** So, this word key… 

**Erica:** Important. 

**Marco:** Means important, right? 

**Erica:** Really important. 

**Marco:** Really important. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So I can say a key game is a really important game. 

**Erica:** Exactly. You could also maybe say a key player. 

**Marco:** Key player is a really important player. 

**Erica:** Uhu, or even a key goal. 

**Marco:** A key goal, okay. So, let's take a look at our last word now, finals. 

**Erica:** Finals. 

**Marco:** Finals. 

**Erica:** The finals. 

**Marco:** So, the finals are the last games. 

**Erica:** That's right., um, and the winner of the finals wins the championship. 

**Marco:** Okay. For example, in the World Cup in soccer… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** There's only one game played in the finals. So, after everyone gets eliminated there's the one game where the winner is the champion. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, now we're ready to listen to our dialogue and it's gonna be a little bit faster than usual… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Because it's a sport commentator, right? 

**Erica:** And it's exciting. 

**Marco:** And it's exciting. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And there's a lot of action, so don't worry about listen to it and then we'll come back and talk about some of the vocabulary. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so the Canadians versus the Russians, ha? 

**Erica:** It reminds me of a classic classic game. 

**Marco:** Exactly, the classic match. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So let's take a look at some of the vocabulary that we heard in the dialogue in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** We have five phrases in language takeaway today, um, and the first one is face off. 

**Marco:** Face off. 

**Erica:** Face off. 

**Marco:** Face off. 

**Erica:** So, Marco, a face off here is a noun, right? 

**Marco:** It's a noun… 

**Erica:** Uh. 

**Marco:** Exactly. And it's… so in the beginning of the match the two players will stand face to face. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Right, that's why it's called kind of a face off. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And the referee will drop the puck. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And they'll try to get it. 

**Erica:** Exactly, so that's the face off. 

**Marco:** That's the face off. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's take a look at our next word, check. 

**Erica:** Check. 

**Marco:** To check. 

**Erica:** To check. So an interesting verb here, hey? 

**Marco:** It… yeah, it's really interesting because it's different from the way that you would say check or revise, right? 

**Erica:** Yes, yep. 

**Marco:** This is actually kind of a violent move. 

**Erica:** Yeah. So what do you do? 

**Marco:** So basically in hockey you take your body and you hit another person with it. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, to check someone is to hit them with you body. 

**Marco:** With your body, right. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** You can't use your arms or your legs or your hands, you can only hit them like with your shoulder or your… or your hip. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Sort of hip check. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, yeah. It's very cool. 

**Erica:** Alright. 

**Marco:** Our net word, goalie. 

**Erica:** Goalie. 

**Marco:** Goalie. 

**Erica:** Goalie. 

**Marco:** A goalie is a person. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** And probably the bravest… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Of the hockey match. 

**Erica:** No kidding. 

**Marco:** So, why don't you tell us what the goalie does? 

**Erica:** Um, the goalie prevents the puck from coming in the net. 

**Marco:** From going into the goal, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, so the goalie stops the other team from getting a goal. 

**Marco:** A goal. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, the goalie prevents the goals. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright, very interesting. Now, our fourth word is related to goalie. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Save. 

**Erica:** Save. 

**Marco:** Save. 

**Erica:** A save. 

**Marco:** A save, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's a noun here. 

**Marco:** It's a noun here. So, the goalie makes saves. 

**Erica:** That's right. When he stops a goal he makes a save. 

**Marco:** Makes a save, right. 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, we have some examples, so we can understand this form of using save. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Example One** 

> A: That was an unbelievable save! 

**Example Two** 

> B: The goalie didn't make the save. 

**Example Three** 

> C: What a save! The Russians win! 

**Erica:** Yeah, a little bit unusual hear that save is a noun instead of a verb but I think those examples were helpful. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Now let's take a look at our last word. Breakaway. 

**Erica:** Breakaway. 

**Marco:** Breakaway. 

**Erica:** A breakaway. 

**Marco:** Okay, so you have two words there that we know already. Break. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Right. And away. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** So what do these two words together actually mean? 

**Erica:** Well, imagine a group of hockey players all fighting to get the puck, right? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And then one player breaks off… breaks out… 

**Marco:** Escapes. 

**Erica:** Of the group, yeah, yeah-yeah. And he is… he skates down the ice and he has the puck. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And he's far away from the other players. 

**Marco:** Right, right, so he's going away from the other players by himself. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, so breakaway. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright. So, we've looked at a lot of hockey language here. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** And I think it's time now to listen to our dialogue again. This time we're gonna slow it down a little bit. 

**Erica:** Yes. I think this will help you to understand these words a little bit better. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Okay, this dialogue is interesting because we have commentators narrating or describing what's happening. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** In that moment, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, and they're using some interesting grammar, aren't they? 

**Marco:** Exactly, they are, because some actions are happening in that moment, but… we noticed something a little bit strange. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, let's look at it in "grammar breakdown". Voice: Grammar breakdown. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's listen to this sentence that we previously heard in the dialogue. Sentence 1: Maurice Richard has the puck now and passes it to the center, he shoots! Maurice Richard has the puck now and passes it to the center, he shoots! 

**Erica:** I noticed that he's using the present simple, right? 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah, even though the action is now… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** It's in present simple. 

**Marco:** Yes, even though the action is happening in that moment he's not using the present progressive… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or the present continuous [NOTE: present progressive = present continuous] 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** This is because, if you noticed, the actions are very very brief. 

**Erica:** And fast. 

**Marco:** And fast. 

**Erica:** And exciting. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So you… don't really have enough time to say, for, example, he is shooting… right? 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Because it's only one quick action, he shoots the puck very fast. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right. Or for example, you wouldn't really say he is passing. 

**Erica:** Yeah, he is passing the puck. 

**Marco:** Right. It's just one quick action, he takes it and he passes it and the action is finished. 

**Erica:** Yes, I think we can see a few more examples of this. Let's listen again. Sentence 2: The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack. The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack. 

**Erica:** Here we can hear that he's using the present simple again, because these are very short actions that finished quickly, right? 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** And it… it's actually very very common when you're describing something you see… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** That's happening now… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** That's really exciting, it's common to use present simple. 

**Marco:** Exactly, if you pay attention, most sporting events are in the same way, right? 

**Erica:** Yep, uhu. 

**Marco:** Ah, they would describe the actions that are happening in the present simple. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Not present progressive. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but Marco, you have an example of, um… up some present progressive here, right? 

**Marco:** Yes, let's listen to this sentence. Sentence 3: He is flying down the ice. He is flying down the ice. 

**Marco:** Now, we heard this sentence he is flying down the ice. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right. Now this one in the progressive. 

**Erica:** Yeah, why is that? 

**Marco:** Well, first of all, when we say he's flying down the ice is not that he's literally flying, okay? 

**Erica:** No, he's not in the airplane. 

**Marco:** He's just skating really fast… 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Right. So we kind of exaggerate and we say oh, he's flying down the ice, but he's actually skating… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, this is a progressive action… 

**Erica:** So, it's… 

**Marco:** He is doing it. 

**Erica:** It's happening for more than one second. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Exactly. So that's why we would say he's flying down the ice instead of he flies down the ice. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Unless he was like really really really fast. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Okay, so here we see that sometimes in English we do use present simple to talk about what's happening now, right? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** When it happens really really quickly. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Or when we want to show that it's really exciting. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Makes it much more exciting if we just use the present simple. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's listen to this exciting dialogue one more time and we'll come back and talk a little bit more. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so hockey is the Canadian national sport. 

**Erica:** Well, actually it isn't… 

**Marco:** It isn't. 

**Erica:** The national sport, yeah. 

**Marco:** What is it? 

**Erica:** Lacrosse isn't… 

**Marco:** Lacrosse! 

**Erica:** Yeah, but anyway, we're not… we don't have a lesson about lacrosse today. 

**Marco:** Not yet. 

**Erica:** No, um, but actually all Canadians love hockey. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Like we start playing hockey when we're about two years old. 

**Marco:** Yeah, I've heard that… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I've heard that, ah, some Canadian children learn how to skate before they learn how to walk. 

**Erica:** It's totally common. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, it's a great sport, very very exciting, it's very fast paced. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And it's very aggressive, that's what I like about it. 

**Erica:** I know. 

**Marco:** Not violent, but very aggressive. 

**Erica:** Yep, but you know what, I must tell you that I'm not a good Canadian, um… 

**Marco:** You're not a hockey fan? 

**Erica:** No, I'm not. 

**Marco:** Really? 

**Erica:** Yeah, I really… I really hate hockey. 

**Marco:** Why? 

**Erica:** Um, I… you know what the puck is so small, it's hard to see where it is on the ice and it's cold and… these guys are fighting and anyway. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Have you ever been on a hockey game? 

**Erica:** Yeah, um… 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** Many times and I just find that the puck is really small. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Maybe you just need better seats. 

**Erica:** Maybe. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, what do you guys think about hock? We'll post some… some videos and some pictures of hockey on… on the comment sections, so you more or less see a little bit more about this really interesting sport and tell us what you think about it.
