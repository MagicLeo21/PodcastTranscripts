## Using the ATM

---

**Marco:** Hello everyone! Welcome back to another great lesson here with us at EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're gonna be getting money. 

**Erica:** That's right. We're going to have a lesson about the ATM. 

**Marco:** The ATM or… 

**Erica:** Automatic Teller Machine. 

**Marco:** Okay, that's what it stands for, ATM. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, we're gonna be looking at the language that you'll probably find in an ATM maybe in the United States or in an English speaking country. 

**Erica:** That's right. Um, but before we begin, why don't we look at some vocabulary that we'll hear in the dialogue? 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Marco:** As we mentioned, the ATM or automatic teller machine is the machine where you get your money, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** And also, well, some people or in different places they may call it the bank machine. 

**Erica:** Yeah, or maybe the cash machine. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Or just a money machine or something. Alright… 

**Erica:** So, ATM. 

**Marco:** ATM. And now, let's take a look at our next word. 

**Erica:** Local authorities. 

**Marco:** The local authorities. 

**Erica:** The local authorities. 

**Marco:** So, what are the local authorities? 

**Erica:** Well, basically, it's the police. 

**Marco:** The police. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Why do you say local authorities? 

**Erica:** Okay, well, authority is, uh, the person in charge, right? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** The boss. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** So, the local authorities are basically people who are the boss of this place. 

**Marco:** In that area. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so… 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** The police. 

**Marco:** The local authorities. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, why don't we start now with our dialogue? Why are we talking about local authorities and ATM machines? 

**Erica:** I don't know. We gotta listen to find out. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, it's not his day today. I think he was very, uh, unlucky and I… maybe he's gonna be in trouble. 

**Erica:** I know and he was on a date. This is probably one of the worst things that can happen to a guy when he's on a date. 

**Marco:** Alright, yeah, so, well, we saw some of, ah, language that was related to an ATM, money and banking. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, why don't we take a look at that now in "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, so, the guy had to insert his card into the slot. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, slot. 

**Erica:** Slot. 

**Marco:** Alright, slot. And that is an opening, right? Or a type of hole, maybe. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's a hole that is usually long. 

**Marco:** Long and… it's like a rectangular hole. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it… a slot is never a circle. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, for example, when you get mail… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** The mailman will put into your mailbox through the slot. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** Okay. Now, well… and now that he put his card into the slot, he had to input a six-digit PIN code. 

**Erica:** Wanna just do both together? Digit and PIN code. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, a six-digit PIN code. 

**Marco:** Alright, now, we have two words here that are new. Digit. 

**Erica:** Digit is basically a number between zero and nine. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, any number between zero and nine is considered a digit. 

**Erica:** Yes, so, one hundred (100) is made up of three digits. 

**Marco:** Three digits, okay. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And what about PIN code? [NOTE: PIN is the acronym that stands for a personal identification number] 

**Erica:** A PIN code is your secret number that you use to take money out. 

**Marco:** Now, why wouldn't we say password? 

**Erica:** Password is usually letters. 

**Marco:** Okay, and PIN code is numbers. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Alright. He had to input his six-digit PIN code and then, after that, he had to press the pound key. 

**Erica:** Pound key. 

**Marco:** Now, this is strange, a pound key, what is that? 

**Erica:** Well, you know on a phone… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** On the bottom right… 

**Marco:** Aha. 

**Erica:** There's a key, um, th… or a button that looks like a number sign. 

**Marco:** Number sign, so, kind of like two vertical lines and two horizontal lines. 

**Erica:** Yeah, two lines going up and down, two lines going across. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that's called the pound key. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright, what about the other one? 

**Erica:** It's called the star. 

**Marco:** The star. 

**Erica:** Star key. 

**Marco:** The star key, alright. So, after the PIN code, after the pound key, now he's ready to withdraw money. 

**Erica:** Uhu. So, we heard withdrawal. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, withdrawal is… 

**Erica:** Is a noun; it's the action of taking money out. 

**Marco:** Okay a withdrawal. 

**Erica:** A withdrawal. 

**Marco:** Okay, and to withdraw. 

**Erica:** To withdraw is just the verb. 

**Marco:** To take out money, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** So, we have the noun and the verb. The only difference is an –al at the end. 

**Erica:** Yes, so withdrawal – noun, and withdraw – verb. 

**Marco:** Okay, and, well, he wanted to withdraw money, but something happened with the ATM and it turned out that he was gonna transfer money. [NOTE: we have here the future in the past; please check this link and listen to this lesson for more information about this grammar topic] 

**Erica:** Oh-oh. 

**Marco:** Hehe. So, transfer. 

**Erica:** Transfer. 

**Marco:** Transfer. 

**Erica:** When you transfer money, you take it from one place and put it in another. 

**Marco:** Okay, and usually in banking when you transfer money, you don't really see it, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** It's all electronic… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, you just put it from one bank account to another, but you never actually see this money. 

**Erica:** Exactly, so, transfer money. 

**Marco:** Transfer. 

**Erica:** And now, this one also has a verb and a noun, right? 

**Marco:** Right, a transfer. 

**Erica:** And to transfer. 

**Marco:** Same word. 

**Erica:** Uh, yep. 

**Marco:** Easy. Alright, so, why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time? It's gonna be slowed down a little bit and then we'll come back and look at some phrases. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Okay, so, that was a little easier to understand, um… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** But, Marco, there're some interesting phrases here, some instructions that you commonly, um, read or hear when you're using a bank machine. 

**Marco:** So, why don't we take a look at these phrases in "fluency builder"? 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** Well, the bank machine told this guy to insert your card. 

**Marco:** Insert your card. 

**Erica:** Insert your card. 

**Marco:** So, this verb - to insert. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** To place inside. 

**Erica:** Exactly, so, what else can we insert? 

**Marco:** Well, for example, commonly you insert a disc. 

**Erica:** Yeah, in your computer. 

**Marco:** In your computer, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, or maybe insert a CD into your CD-player. 

**Marco:** Or DVD into your DVD-player. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, to insert something - to put inside. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So, he had to insert his card into the slot. 

**Erica:** And then the bank machine asked him to select an option. 

**Marco:** Select an option. 

**Erica:** Select an option. 

**Marco:** Now, this is a very common, ah, phrase that you will… not only see in ATMs, but basically everywhere, right? 

**Erica:** Like in… computers or the Internet or many… many things where you're dealing with machines. 

**Marco:** Uhu. So, it's a… it's an order that says "well, select one of these choices that you have". 

**Erica:** Make a choice. 

**Marco:** Make a choice. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Select an option. Alright, so… two simple phrases, but very useful and also very high frequency, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, and you know what? When you use phrases like these two, it sounds quite professional, doesn't it? 

**Marco:** Yeah, a… a little bit formal. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, Erica, so, what about you? Have you ever had any problems with the ATM? 

**Erica:** I've had more problems than I can count. 

**Marco:** Hehe. What happened? 

**Erica:** Well, I think in the last two years I've probably lost about seven bank cards in an ATM. 

**Marco:** Really? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** You forget it… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** In the slot. 

**Erica:** Yeah, I leave it in the slot and then walk away from the bank machine and… no bank cards. 

**Marco:** Well, I think now the ATMs, because this is the common problem… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Um, now they have like a little alarm that when you take out your money and everything, it just starts beeping and beeping until you take out your card. 

**Erica:** Yes and I like the bank machines that actually give you your card first… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And then give you your money. 

**Marco:** Ah. 

**Erica:** Cause if they give me my money first, that's all I want, right? 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** So, I run away with my money and leave my card in the bank machine. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Right, I think that's a good idea. I've… I've never seen that before, though. 

**Erica:** In Switzerland they have them like that. 

**Marco:** In Switzerland. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or what about the ATMs that you only have to swipe your card? [NOTE: in this context swipe means to pass your card through a special machine/device that "reads" the information encoded in a magnetic strip of the card] 

**Erica:** Oh, yeah, I've done that as well and also ruined a bank card with that. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** I swiped it too many times, put in a wrong PIN code and… 

**Marco:** It blocked your card. 

**Erica:** Yeah, terrible. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, what about you guys? I su… I'm sure everyone has some experience or some inconvenience with ATM machines. So, why don't you come to our website and tell us all about it? 

**Erica:** You can also find lots more resources on our website, uh, to help your learn English, so check it out and until next time… 

**Marco:** Good bye! 

**Erica:** Bye!
