## Weather Forecast

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're gonna be talking about the weather. 

**Erica:** That's right, and, you know Marco, this is a really, really useful and important topic in English, isn't it? 

**Marco:** Exactly, because if you ever travel abroad, you always wanna know about the weather, right? 

**Erica:** That's right, and Anglo people… English people, all they ever do is talk about the weather. 

**Marco:** Well, it's an important topic; you wanna know what clothes to wear or if you should take an umbrella. 

**Erica:** Or even when you're making small talk with people. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, we're gonna be taking a look at the weather in the United States, but before we get started with the dialogue, let's take a look at "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Okay, so, we have two words we're gonna hear in the dialogue. Now, the first one is forecast. 

**Marco:** Forecast. 

**Erica:** Weather forecast. 

**Marco:** So, this is what we listen to or what we see on the television - theweather forecast. 

**Erica:** Right, it's like the prediction of the weather. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, forecast. Can I only use it in the weather? 

**Erica:** No, of… of course, you can use it in many other different situations like in business, for example – forecast sales. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, the prediction of sales. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Very good, and we have one more word on vocabulary preview – ashower. 

**Erica:** A shower. 

**Marco:** Shower. 

**Erica:** Shower. So, when it… when it rains for a short p… time and it's now too heavy, that's a shower. 

**Marco:** Okay, very good, so, it's very similar to a… shower at home. 

**Erica:** Right, it doesn't… 

**Marco:** It… a little bit of water… 

**Erica:** And it doesn't last too long. 

**Marco:** Okay… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Very good. So, why don't we listen to our dialogue now? We are gonna be listening to the weatherman as he describes the weather in Utah. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, we listened to the weather forecast and it doesn't seem like nice weather in Utah, ha? 

**Erica:** No, it certainly doesn't. Uh, I don't think that I would really, uh, like to live there. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, maybe it's winter or something like that. 

**Erica:** Well, I guess m… yeah, maybe it's good for skiing. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, now I think it's time for us to take a look at some of those maybe difficult words, that we may have listened to in this dialogue, in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, here we're gonna look at some words and phrases that you can use to describe the weather. Now, the first one – we heard in the weather forecast that they were calling for scattered showers. 

**Marco:** Scattered showers. 

**Erica:** Scatter. 

**Marco:** Scattered. If something is scattered… 

**Erica:** It's sort of like, um… it's a little bit of that thing everywhere. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, and we already talked about what showers were. 

**Erica:** Right, so, s… shower is, uh, a small bit of… a small amount of rain. 

**Marco:** Okay, very good. To better understand when something is scattered, imagine that we are in a playground and the children are playing in the playground. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, the children are scattered everywhere; some of them are playing on the swing, some of them are playing, uh, on the grass or in the sandbox. So, children… a little bit of children in every different spot. 

**Erica:** So, if we think that the city is a playground, um, maybe in one part of the city there's a little bit of rain, but not in the other part. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** That's a scattered shower. 

**Marco:** Very good! Moving on to our second word – we have hovering. 

**Erica:** Hovering. 

**Marco:** Temperature's hovering around the thirty degree mark. 

**Erica:** The temperature is hovering around. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, when I say the temperatures are hovering… 

**Erica:** You mean it's approximately… 

**Marco:** Okay, so, they can move up and down, so, maybe it'll be a little bit warmer than thirty degrees or a little bit colder. 

**Erica:** Yes! So, if you think of hovering as floating. 

**Marco:** Okay, very good! So, why don't we listen to some more examples of how we could use hovering in different situations? 

**Example One** 

> A: Unemployment rates are hovering around the ten percent mark despite the government's attempts to stimulate the economy. 

**Example Two** 

> B: The waiter has kept hovering around us all night; it was really annoying. 

**Example Three** 

> C: The company's margin this year is hovering around the forty percent mark. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, pretty clear, hovering is sort of floating around one area. 

**Marco:** Very good. Now, let's move on to the next part. We saw that we're gonna have isolated downpours. 

**Erica:** Isolated downpours. 

**Marco:** Isolated downpours. 

**Erica:** Okay, let's break this one down. Um, let's start with downpour. 

**Marco:** A downpour is when you have a lot of rain, very strong rain. 

**Erica:** That's right, for maybe a short amount of time it's really raining heavily. 

**Marco:** Right, so, that's what a downpour is. And if we take a look at the first word – isolated… 

**Erica:** So, in one small area. 

**Marco:** Okay, confined to a specific area. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, we have an isolated downpour - it'll be raining in one specific area. 

**Erica:** And you hear this a lot with weather language. You s… hear isolated showers, isolated snowstorms. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, it'll be in a specific area only. 

**Erica:** Alright, so, along with the… these showers and rain, we also talked about wind and… and we heard that we will have gusts reaching 23 miles per hour. 

**Marco:** So, we're gonna have gusts reaching 23 miles per hour. 

**Erica:** Gusts of wind. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, can you explain, uh, to our listeners what gusts are? 

**Erica:** Okay, so, a gust is a sudden increase in the amount of wind. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, maybe we will have normal wind and… and all of a sudden it will get really windy. 

**Erica:** That's right, for a short amount of time. 

**Marco:** Okay, that's a gust. 

**Erica:** G-U-S-T, gust. 

**Marco:** Gust of wind. And for our final word on language takeaway today we're gonna have sleet. 

**Erica:** Sleet. 

**Marco:** Sleet. 

**Erica:** Alright, sleet is a terrible kind of weather, it's sort of a mixture between snow and rain. 

**Marco:** So, sleet is kind of this strange mix between ice and… and rain and snow. So, just imagine, it's not completely ice, so it's not solid. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** But, it's not water, right? It's not rain. It's something… 

**Erica:** And it's not snow either. 

**Marco:** No, it's in the middle. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, sleet. 

**Erica:** But what you really need to know is that it's terrible. 

**Marco:** Haha. Alright, so, that's all the words we have today for language takeaway. Let's move on now to "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** Alright, on fluency builder today we're gonna look at three phrases that are really common when you're talking about the weather. Now, we heard in the dialogue that there was a cold front moving in. 

**Marco:** A cold front moving in. 

**Erica:** A cold front is moving in. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, a cold front. 

**Erica:** Imagine a wall… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Of cold air. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Um, and it… and it comes towards a place and then it changes the pressure in the atmosphere. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, uh, very sudden amount of… of cold air that comes into a place. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** So, we say a cold front is moving in. 

**Erica:** Uhu. So, we always think of these cold fronts or warm fronts as… as moving. So, you can either say they're moving in or you can say a cold front is coming in. 

**Marco:** Okay, very good, and… okay, we have a cold front that's moving in and we're gonna have winds that will be coming in from the North-East. 

**Erica:** Okay, winds coming in from. 

**Marco:** Okay, winds coming in from. So, when I say it's coming in from… 

**Erica:** You're talking about its origin, where it starts. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, if I change the noun and I say… and I don't say winds anymore, but maybe I'll say "my friends". 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** My friends are coming in from… 

**Erica:** Chicago. 

**Marco:** Chicago, so… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** They are arriving from Chicago. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** What else can I say? 

**Erica:** Or you can also say "the kids are coming in from outside". 

**Marco:** Okay, so, where they were before. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Very good, so, coming in from, you can change the noun a little bit and you can form these new sentences. 

**Erica:** Great! Now, our final phrase – we heard the announcer say "it's gonna be a cold one". 

**Marco:** It's gonna be a cold one. 

**Erica:** It's gonna be a cold one. 

**Marco:** So, I have this phrase "it's gonna be a cold one"; what do I mean by a cold one? 

**Erica:** Okay, so, the one represents the event, so the day, right? 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it's gonna be a cold day. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Now, we can obviously change the adjective, right? So, it's gonna be a hot one; it's gonna be a long one – it's gonna be a long day. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** But we… the one can mean anything. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it can be a day, it can be, uh, an event. 

**Erica:** Meeting. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** A project. So, for example, if we're going to a meeting, I might say "hey Marco, this is gonna be a hard one". 

**Marco:** Okay, so, the m… the one represents the meeting. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** This is gonna be a hard meeting. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright, I think this is a very good phrase and it's very commonly used. So, why don't we listen to some more examples of how we can use it's gonna be a something one? 

**Example One** 

> A: Temperatures are forecasted to hit 37 degrees today; it's going to be a hot one, folks! [NOTE: 37 degrees here is in degrees Celsiuswhereas in the dialogue the temperatures are in degrees Fahrenheitas used in the USA] 

**Example Two** 

> B: It's only 8 a.m. and I've got a hundred e-mails already; it's gonna be a long one today! 

**Example Three** 

> C: I haven't studied at all for the exam; it's gonna be a tough one. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, some great examples and I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again and now we can understand all these words and phrases that we've just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** 

**Erica:** Okay, so, we know that in English speaking countries the weather is always, always, always a great subject of conversation for small talk, right? 

**Marco:** Exactly, if you ever wanna talk to somebody or start a conversation, the weather is always a number one topic. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and we actually have a phrase in this dialogue that'd be great for starting a conversation like, for example, imagine if you lived here in Utah, and you were, you know, wanting to start a conversation with someone, you could say "it sure is a cold one today, isn't it?" 

**Marco:** Exactly, that's a great way of staring a conversation and English speaking people love to talk about the weather as you say.
