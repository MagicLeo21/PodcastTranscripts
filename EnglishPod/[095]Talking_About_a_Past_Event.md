## Talking About a Past Event

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we have a very special lesson, because we're gonna be focusing a little bit more on grammar. 

**Erica:** That's right! Uh, we're going to look today at the difference between past simple and past progressive or sometimes called past continuous. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, we are going to take a look at these two structures, which are a little bit confusing at times and we're gonna be practicing today, but before we get started, why don't we take a look at "vocabulary preview"? 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Well, this dialogue is all about telling a story in the past and we're gonna hear two words in the dialogue that we need to understand the meaning of. So, the first one – ages. 

**Marco:** Ages. 

**Erica:** I haven't seen you in ages. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, if I tell you I haven't seen you in ages… 

**Erica:** Basically, you haven't seen me in a really long time. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it's a way of exaggerating a little bit. 

**Erica:** Yes, um, and this word ages we can use, um, in many different ways like "Oh, I've been studying English for ages". 

**Marco:** Or, for example, I can say "I haven't been to the dentist's in ages". 

**Erica:** Oh, well, I guess you'd better go, ha? 

**Marco:** Hehe. Right, so, ages – a very long time. 

**Erica:** Yes! Now, another phrase – to run into somebody. 

**Marco:** So, to run into somebody. 

**Erica:** I ran into Matt. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, if you ran into Matt the other day… 

**Erica:** You met him unexpectedly. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you didn't plan to meet, you didn't have a date. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** You just casually, on the street, met. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I ran into your friend the other day. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, two good words; we're gonna hear both of these in the dialogue. So, why don't we get started with "**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME**"? 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, very good, so, a funny story and as we saw a lot of stuff in the past, right? 

**Erica:** That's right and we're gonna look at that in a moment, but first we've got lots of exciting language to describe, um, when somebody gets really emotional. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, why don't we start now with "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** We have four words here. Now, in the dialogue, um, the guy in the story lost it. 

**Marco:** So, he saw a mouse and he completely lost it. 

**Erica:** To lose it. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, when you lose some… you lose it, what are you losing? 

**Erica:** You're losing control of yourself and your emotion. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you lose your temper maybe. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** So, when I lose it, do I just get angry? 

**Erica:** Angry or upset or even sad… 

**Marco:** Your… 

**Erica:** But it's usually a negative feeling. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it's not a good thing to lose it. 

**Erica:** No, so, for example, when I showed my boss the sales figures he completely lost it. 

**Marco:** Okay, very good. So, that's what lose it means. And now our second word is very similar, but has a little bit of a difference. 

**Erica:** That's right! He started freaking out. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, to freak out. 

**Erica:** To freak out. 

**Marco:** Now, freak out is very similar to lose it, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, but why don't we hear an example now of somebody freaking out. Example 1: Is just… ah, no! No! Okay, forget it! Forget it! Alright, just, forget it! I don't even wanna… just… I just wanna forget it! I just wanna forget it! I… uh! I don't know! I don't know! Example 2: Okay, calm down, huh! God! Hehe, what? I got a calm down! I'm so happy again! I can't even express it! I'm like… I haven't… have… I even finished one sentence! I'm like… Hehe! Huh! Gimme a hi-five, baby! 

**Marco:** Alright, so, we heard this person freaking out and basically it could be losing control or losing your temper, but also in a positive way. 

**Erica:** Right, so, maybe, um, you're really excited about something that's going to happen, so you're freaking out. 

**Marco:** Okay, maybe you're very nervous or you're very excited. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright! And now moving on to our third word – stare. 

**Erica:** To stare. 

**Marco:** People started to stare. 

**Erica:** Staring. 

**Marco:** Okay, now, when you stare at someone or at something… 

**Erica:** You look at and focus at something for a really long time. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you're looking at it. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or focusing on it 

**Erica:** Yeah, longer than usual. 

**Marco:** Alright, maybe when we were small, our parents taught us that it's not nice to stare… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** At other people. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, to stare. 

**Erica:** And our final word – when Matt saw the mouse he startedshrieking. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, to shriek. 

**Erica:** Shriek. 

**Marco:** Shriek. Very similar to that movie Shrek. 

**Erica:** Oh, yeah, it sounds quite similar. 

**Marco:** Alright, but it's different. What does shriek mean? 

**Erica:** Well, why don't we listen to an example? Example of shrieking. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, I think shrieking is to shout in a very high pitched voice. 

**Marco:** Exactly, that's to shriek. Okay, so, we saw four really great words in language takeaway and why don't we listen now to the dialogue for a second time a little bit slower? And then we'll come back and look at the differences between simple past and past progressive. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Okay, so, there's a lot of different uses of past tense here in this dialogue, wasn't there? 

**Marco:** Yeah, since he was telling a story that happened, he used thepast a lot. 

**Erica:** Well, let's now as promised look at past simple and past progressive in "grammar breakdown". Voice: Grammar breakdown. 

**Erica:** Okay, Marco, before we start our discussion, why don't we hear one example of past simple and one example of past progressive? Example of past simple: You know, just last week I ran into Matt as well. Example of past progressive: Well, we were talking, catching up on we've been doing. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, we heard that "just last week I ran into Matt", so, we discussed what ran into means. 

**Erica:** Yep, to meet someone by surprise. 

**Marco:** Alright, and now this structure is the simple past, right? 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Now, the second example that we heard was "we were talking and catching up". 

**Erica:** Okay, so, let's look at the difference in meaning here. "I ran into Matt" – happened in the past, right? 

**Marco:** Right, simple past. 

**Erica:** But one moment in the past. 

**Marco:** So, the action finished, concluded. 

**Erica:** Started and finished all around the same time, so, it's one simple moment. 

**Marco:** Okay. Now, the other example is in the past progressive, so, the action was happening for a longer period of time. 

**Erica:** Yeah, okay, so, let… let's… let's attach some times to this. Um, maybe you ran into Matt at 8:04, okay? And so the action started at 8:04, but you were talking and caching up from 

8:05 until 9:05. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you were talking for an hour. 

**Erica:** Right, so, it's a l… the past progressive you use, um, when you're… when an action is happening for a longer period of time. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, to better understand this, let's have another example. Example of past simple: Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it. Example of past progressive: Everyone was staring and laughing. 

**Marco:** So, as we heard in the example, he "saw a mouse run under his chair". 

**Erica:** So, a quick action that started and finished quickly. 

**Marco:** Okay, he saw the mouse and it ran under the chair. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Now, the second example we heard was "everyone was staring and laughing". 

**Erica:** So, maybe this happened over four or five minutes. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, people were looking at him and laughing and talking about how he was screaming like a girl. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that's the main difference between the simple past and the past progressive – th… amount of time that the action happened. 

**Erica:** Yep. Alright, well, now that we understand a little bit more about the past tense, why don't we hear again in context by listening to the dialogue for a third time? 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, perfect, so, now that we understand the words and the grammar behind it, there're some interesting phrases here that you can use casually with your friends. 

**Erica:** Here there's actually a lot of great sort of meeting and greeting and saying hello language. 

**Marco:** Uhu. So, for example, when they met up, since they were old friends, he said "Hey, Pat!" 

**Erica:** Hey! 

**Marco:** Okay, so, this word hey. 

**Erica:** It's kind of like "hi". 

**Marco:** It's "hi", right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Ju… and normally you would use it to get somebody's attention, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Like hey, "I'm over here", some… 

**Erica:** Hey, waiter! 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But in this case like "hey, how's it going" or "hi". 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, it's a really friendly and informal way of saying "hi". 

**Marco:** Okay, and then he asked "how's it going?" 

**Erica:** How's it going? 

**Marco:** So, again, this is a way of saying "how are you?" 

**Erica:** Yeah, Marco, what's the correct answer to this greeting? 

**Marco:** Well… well, for example, he said "things are going great", right? 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** You can say "yeah, things are great" or "I'm doing well". 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or… 

**Erica:** Even "great", you know… 

**Marco:** Great! 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, how's it going? 

**Marco:** Oh, it's great! 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Right? Now, another one that we didn't see in the dialogue, but it's very popular is when somebody asks "hey, what's up?" 

**Erica:** Yeah, what's up? So, again, what is the right way to answer this question? 

**Marco:** Alright, so, when somebody says "what's up", you can say "well, not much" of if maybe you have news or something that you wanna share, you would say "well, I just got back from the doctor's office". 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Right? But you wouldn't say "fine, thank you" or you wouldn't say "very good" or any of these other common answers to "what's up". 

**Erica:** That's right! 

**Marco:** It can be a little bit tricky. 

**Erica:** Yeah, then… so, the rule is the normal thing to say when someone says "hey, what's up?" is "nothing much". 

**Marco:** Not much. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright… so, interning ways of greeting casually with people, right? You wouldn't use this for, ah… with your boss maybe or in an office setting. 

**Erica:** Yeah, more… more useful with your friends. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, if you have any other questions or have any other informal greetings that you would like to share with us, come toenglishpod.com. 

**Erica:** Yeah, Marco and I are always around to answer your questions and we look forward to hearing from you, so, until next time… 

**Marco:** Bye! 

**Erica:** Bye!
