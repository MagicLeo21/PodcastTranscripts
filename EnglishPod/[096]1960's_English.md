## 1960's English

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we are going back in time again and this time we're gonna be in the nineteen sixties (1960's). 

**Erica:** That's right! We're going to learn some, uh, phrases and some slang that were really popular back in nineteen sixty four… 

**Marco:** Exactly! And most of these phrases and words we still use today, so, it's very interesting and very good to know. 

**Erica:** That's right! I'm looking forward to, uh, this trip back in time, so, why don't we get started with the dialogue? 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, great dialogue - very popular in the sixties - the music, the mood… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And the words, right? 

**Erica:** That's right! 

**Marco:** So, why don't we get down to business and look at the vocabulary that we saw in this dialogue in "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Well, the dialogue opened and we heard this guy say "hey man, I really like your pad". 

**Marco:** I really like your pad. 

**Erica:** Pad. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, pad – a very informal way of saying… 

**Erica:** Your apartment. 

**Marco:** Your apartment, right? 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And now, it's… you can still use it today. 

**Erica:** Yeah, that's right, we often hear the expression bachelor pad. 

**Marco:** Okay, a bachelor pad. 

**Erica:** So, that's an apartment where a single man lives. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, a bachelor pad. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Usually, it's very nicely decorated and really… a nice apartment, right? 

**Erica:** Or maybe it has empty pizza boxes all over the floor, Marco. 

**Marco:** Also a bachelor pad. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But, so, that's what pad means – an apartment. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** They were talking about the apartment and he said "the lava lamps are far out". 

**Erica:** Far out. 

**Marco:** Okay, it's far out. 

**Erica:** So, that's really cool or amazing. 

**Marco:** Right, and now, lava lamps, those are those, ah, strange calm-looking lamps, right? 

**Erica:** Kind of a light with like some liquid moving inside it. 

**Marco:** Moving inside. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Very popular in the sixties. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So… 

**Erica:** We'll post some pictures of that. 

**Marco:** Yeah, and the lamps are far out, so, now you can use that with other things, right? Like you are really far out. 

**Erica:** Yeah, or this music is really far out. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** It kind of gives you the feeling like it sort of spacey. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Spacey. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, the pad is really far out, the lava lamps are great and he was saying "Thanks for letting me crash here tonight". 

**Erica:** To crash. 

**Marco:** So, to crash at, uh, someone's place. 

**Erica:** Right, so, we're not talking about like a car crash here. 

**Marco:** No, no, no. 

**Erica:** But, so, when you crash somewhere, what do you do? 

**Marco:** Well, you are staying there, then… you're gonna stay there. 

**Erica:** So, you're guest… 

**Marco:** As a guest. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, like sleep, right? 

**Marco:** Aha. 

**Erica:** Yep, and for free. 

**Marco:** For free, yes. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So, if, for example, you're going to New York and you're gonna visit a friend, you might crash at your friend's house. 

**Erica:** That's right, so, interesting word, um, and it is quite commonly used now. So, why don't we hear some examples of how we can use it? 

**Example One** 

> A: Hey man, can I crash at your place tonight? 

**Example Two** 

> B: I lost my keys, so, I'm crashing at my girlfriend's house. 

**Example Three** 

> C: No, you've been sleeping on my coach for a month, you're not gonna crash here tonight! 

**Marco:** Alright, perfect, so, to crash, right? It's still commonly used today. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Now, for the forth word – groovy. 

**Erica:** Groovy. 

**Marco:** That would be groovy. 

**Erica:** So, again, this means like great or cool or really nice. 

**Marco:** Yeah, this is… I think this is one of the main words of the nineteen sixties. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Something was groovy. 

**Erica:** Yes, I agree, so, it kind of gives you the sense that it's sort of really cool, but in a relaxed way. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's groovy. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** This music is really groovy. 

**Erica:** That's right! 

**Marco:** And finally, his friend, he said "hey, I gotta split for a while". 

**Erica:** To split. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, if I say "I have to split". 

**Erica:** You have to leave. 

**Marco:** I have to leave. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Very colloquial. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And it means I have to leave for a little bit. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Split for a while. 

**Erica:** That's right! You may not have heard this one before, so, why don't we hear some examples to help you understand how it's used? 

**Example One** 

> A: Hurry up! We've gotta split before the police get here. 

**Example Two** 

> B: This party is boring; let's split! 

**Example Three** 

> C: I have to wake up early tomorrow, so, we're going to split. 

**Marco:** Okay, very good, so, split. Now also, I think you can use it for relationships, right? Me and him… 

**Erica:** Oh, yeah! 

**Marco:** Me and her… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Me and her split up. [NOTE: This is what was said, but it isn't correct English; one could say "we split up" or "she and I split up"] 

**Erica:** That's right, so, you ended your relationship. 

**Marco:** Yeah, split. Okay, so, we s… we saw five, ah, really common phrases from the nineteen sixties. Let's listen to the dialogue again, a little bit slower, and then we'll come back and look at some phrases from the sixties. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Alright, well, I wanna get started at looking at these, uh, nineteen sixties slang phrases, so, let's go now with "putting it together". 

**Putting It Together** 

**Marco:** Alright, on putting it together today let's start with the first part – he talked about "you dig what I'm saying?" 

**Erica:** "I dig it, man". 

**Marco:** You dig what I'm saying? 

**Erica:** To dig it. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, we know the verb dig, which means to make a hole, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But now, he's talking about understand. 

**Erica:** Yeah, basically, um, you dig what I'm saying - do you understand what I'm saying? 

**Marco:** And when he says "I dig it", he says "I understand". 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, now, there's also another meaning to this, right? Apart fromunderstand. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it can also mean "I like it". 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I really dig this type of music. 

**Erica:** Or I really dig this restaurant. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it's kind of "I like it". 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright, now, moving on… he said "we could throw a bash here". 

**Erica:** Alright, throw a bash. 

**Marco:** To throw a bash. 

**Erica:** So, first of all, what is a bash? 

**Marco:** A bash is a party. 

**Erica:** A really great party. 

**Marco:** An amazing party. 

**Erica:** Now, I wanna look at this verb to throw something, so, we kn… 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** We… we know that you throw a ball, right? 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** But how can you throw a party? 

**Marco:** Well, it's basically saying you organize or you host a party. 

**Erica:** Okay, and how can you use this phrase? 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I can say, uh, "last week I threw a birthday party in my house". 

**Erica:** Okay, or "let's throw a bash to celebrate your engagement". 

**Marco:** Okay, or "next week I'm gonna throw a dinner party at my house". 

**Erica:** Okay, so, to throw a party and it's usually used for… for parties, right? 

**Marco:** Right, you wouldn't throw a… 

**Erica:** Throw a meeting. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Not. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay. So now, we heard them use the ph… word man a lot, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Hey, man. 

**Erica:** Yeah, that's right! Now, this is so common even in modern English that I think we need some examples. 

**Example One** 

> A: Hey, man! Watch where you're going! 

**Example Two** 

> B: Yeah, man! That's a great idea! 

**Example Three** 

> C: Man! That was awesome! 

**Marco:** So, man is one of those words that you just use at the end of your sentences. 

**Erica:** Or at the beginning or… 

**Marco:** Or at the beginning. 

**Erica:** Anywhere. 

**Marco:** And, so, you say "hey, man" or "yeah, man". 

**Erica:** Yeah, but what about, um, do you have to be a man to use it? Or do you have to be talking to a man to use it? 

**Marco:** No, not really. Men and women use the word man. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And you can call a girl like "hey, man, how are you?" 

**Erica:** Yeah, but that sort of means that she's a really, really good friend like the same level of friend as your guy friends. 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Very good! And now, for the last phrase on putting it together – he said "you go take care of business". 

**Erica:** To take care of business. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I have to take care of business. 

**Erica:** So, we're not really talking about business and work here, are we? 

**Marco:** No, no, no, no. So, basically, what we're saying is "go handle your affairs". 

**Erica:** So, do the things you have to do. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, or solve your problem. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, if I say "I have to go to city hall today and take care of some business". 

**Erica:** So, you're maybe gonna do something like… 

**Marco:** Pay my taxes… 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Marco:** Or something like that. 

**Erica:** Yeah. Okay, so, to take care of business. 

**Marco:** Uhu. Okay, so, we heard some great phrases, we saw these words, let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk about this great decade. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, nineteen sixties, very famous among rock music, the peace… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And conflicts and all this stuff. 

**Erica:** Yeah, that's right, and I guess in, um… in English or Anglo pop culture we look back at this decade, um, very fondly. 

**Marco:** Yeah, and also we're really related to the hippie movement, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Marco:** People with long hair and baggy clothes and… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** You know, living in their cars, going from concert to concert. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and I… I mean, speaking of music, I think if we think nineteen sixties, at least in… in Anglo world… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** In Anglo world, we think of the best music like I think this is the golden age of music in… in, um, English speaking countries. 

**Marco:** Yes, it was a very good era and, well, what do you guys think? Do you think the sixties was the best decade or maybe you are more fond of the seventies? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** The disco era.
