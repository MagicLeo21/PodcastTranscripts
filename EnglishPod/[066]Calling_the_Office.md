---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're gonna be bringing you a great lesson about "calling the office". 

**Erica:** Yep, that's right. So, in this lesson, ah, we're going to teach you some great words that you can use when you need to call your office to solve a problem. 

**Marco:** Right, so, you're at home, you have a problem, maybe you can't go to the office, so you have to call them and tell them that you're not gonna be able to go. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, we're not gonna preview anything today, because the dialogue is relatively easy. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and look at some words. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, a pretty easy dialogue, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, pretty simple. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, there're a couple of words that we wanna look at. So, let's start with "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, well, today we're looking at three interesting words. The first one is ooflay. 

**Marco:** Ooflay. 

**Erica:** Ooflay. 

**Marco:** Ooflay. 

**Erica:** Marco, what is the ooflay? 

**Marco:** Alright, so, when you have the ooflay, it means that you're sick, you have, um… it's very similar to a cold. 

**Erica:** Right, but just worse, right? 

**Marco:** Worse, yeah, so, when you have the ooflay it'll keep you in bed for a while, for maybe a week or two. 

**Erica:** So, you have a fever, um, your… your body is hurting. 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

**Erica:** You just… you're really sick. 

**Marco:** Yeah, you're really sick. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, ooflay. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, what about our next word? 

**Marco:** Well, actually, the next word is, ah… is a phrase that you can use when you're calling the office. Alling-cay in ick-say. 

**Erica:** Alling-cay in ick-say. 

**Marco:** Alling-cay in ick-say. 

**Erica:** Okay, this is a really useful phrase and I think it will help us to hear some examples of what it sounds like, so we can understand the meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: ???. 

**Example Two** 

> B: ???. 

**Example Three** 

> C: ??? 

**Marco:** So, with this phrase you're basically saying that you are not going in to the office. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** So, let's take a look at our last word for language takeaway. Eecover-ray. 

**Erica:** Eecover-ray. 

**Marco:** Eecover-ray. 

**Erica:** Eecover-ray. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it's a pretty simple word. Eecover-ray means… 

**Erica:** To get better, to start feeling healthy again. 

**Marco:** Okay, so kind of to recharge your batteries. 

**Erica:** Exactly, so this is a great verb to use when you want to say "I'm going to feel better". 

**Marco:** Okay, eecover-ray. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, some really great words, some, ah, really interesting phrases. Well, let's listen to this dialogue again and then we'll come back.
