## Foul!

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we have another great elementary lesson for you all. 

**Erica:** That's right. We've got a lesson for all you sports fans out there. 

**Marco:** Right, we're doing a podcast on sports today. Uh, we're starting off with basketball. 

**Erica:** Aha. So, we've got lots of language about basketball and sports in this lesson today. 

**Marco:** Great, so, let's take a look at our "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Two words for you today. The first one is foul. 

**Marco:** Foul. 

**Erica:** Foul. 

**Marco:** A foul. 

**Erica:** Basically, it's an action in a game that is not allowed. 

**Marco:** Right, so, if you're playing basketball and you kick the other player… 

**Erica:** That's a foul. 

**Marco:** That's a foul. That's a pretty big foul. 

**Erica:** Yeah, if you're playing soccer and you pick up the ball… 

**Marco:** That's also a foul. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Our second word is ref. 

**Erica:** Ref, R-E-F. 

**Marco:** Also known as a referee. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right? So, a referee is… 

**Erica:** Basically, like the judge of a game. 

**Marco:** The judge of the game. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, he is the one that will… 

**Erica:** Say "that was a foul!" 

**Marco:** That was a foul. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Ref. Also known as referee. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, two great words; we're gonna hear them in our dialogue and we're going to be listening to two guys, who are watching a basketball game on TV. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

> A: Has the game started yet?

> B: Yeah, about 5 minutes ago.

> A: Who's winning?

> B: The Bulls, of course!

> A: What! That wasn't a foul! C'mon, ref!

> B: Don't worry, Shaq always screws up free throws.

> A: You were right! He didn't make the shot!

> B: That was a great shot! A three pointer, yeah!

> A: Did you see that? He traveled and the ref didn't call it!

> B: This ref needs glasses. Hey ref, open your eyes! I can't believe he didn't see that!

> A: Okay… end of the first quarter… Alright, I'm gonna make a beer run.

**Marco:** Alright, a really common situation whenever you're watching games with the friends, right? 

**Erica:** You need to get a beer. 

**Marco:** Hehe. We'll talk about that in a little while. Um, let's take a look at "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Okay, let's take a look at our first word on language takeaway - free throw. 

**Erica:** Free throw. 

**Marco:** Free throw. 

**Erica:** Free throw. This one is a bit hard to say, isn't it? 

**Marco:** It's a little bit hard to explain, but if you're playing basketball… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And if someone fouls you, you get a free throw. 

**Erica:** So, that's when all the players line up around you and you can throw the ball. 

**Marco:** To the basket without anyone blocking you or anything. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** A little bit complicated, but I'm sure the basketball fans understand what a free throw is. 

**Erica:** Alright, our next word is… 

**Marco:** Make the shot. 

**Erica:** Make the shot. 

**Marco:** Make the shot. 

**Erica:** Let's listen to some examples and we'll understand the meaning of make the shot. 

**Example One** 

> A: I can't believe it. He made the shot from the other side of the court. 

**Example Two** 

> B: There's no way he's going to make that shot. He's way too far away from the net. 

**Example Three** 

> C: If Gretzky makes the shot, they're gonna with the Stanley Cup. 

**Marco:** So, it's clear now. To make the shot is to successfully… 

**Erica:** Th… 

**Marco:** Put the ball in the basket. 

**Erica:** You can use this expression in other sports as well, right? 

**Marco:** Yeah, you could use it in hockey. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** To make the shot. You could also use it in golf, when… in a lot of different sports they use the term to shoot. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Shoot the ball. 

**Erica:** So, uh, anytime you shoot the ball, you can make the shot. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, our next word today – three pointer. 

**Erica:** Three pointer. 

**Marco:** Three pointer. 

**Erica:** A three pointer. 

**Marco:** It's a shot in basketball when you get three points. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Usually this shot is taken from further out. 

**Erica:** Yeah, a farther distance. 

**Marco:** Yeah. So it's a little bit more difficult to make this shot. 

**Erica:** Yeah. You know, sometimes people might say "a three point shot" or something like that. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** But our EnglishPod learners, they know… 

**Marco:** It's a three pointer. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you'll sound really knowledgeable, really cool, u… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Using that one. 

**Marco:** Three pointer. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** And, uh, our last word today – travel. 

**Erica:** Travel. 

**Marco:** To travel. 

**Erica:** Travel. When you walk with the basket ball. 

**Marco:** Well, technically you're allowed to take two steps in basketball. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, when you take more than two steps, then it's… 

**Erica:** Alright, alright, alright. 

**Marco:** Traveling. 

**Erica:** I understand. 

**Marco:** Hehe. So, yeah, traveling means to take more than two steps with the ball. 

**Erica:** Let's listen to the dialogue a second time. This time it'll be a bit slower, so that we can understand some of these great phrases we just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

> A: Has the game started yet?

> B: Yeah, about 5 minutes ago.

> A: Who's winning?

> A: You were right! He didn't make the shot!

> B: That was a great shot! A three pointer, yeah!

> A: Did you see that? He traveled and the ref didn't call it!

> B: This ref needs glasses. Hey ref, open your eyes! I can't believe he didn't see that!

> A: Okay… end of the first quarter… Alright, I'm gonna make a beer run.

**Marco:** Alright, sports fans, so now let's take a look at "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** Okay, today on fluency builder we have two really common words that you would listen to while you're watching a game. 

**Erica:** Yeah, these are sort of slangy words, hey? 

**Marco:** Yeah, they're kind of, uh, common… 

**Erica:** Like informal. 

**Marco:** Informal. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** The first one that we have is screw up. 

**Erica:** Screw up. 

**Marco:** Screw up. 

**Erica:** Screw up. 

**Marco:** To screw up. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, this is a good way of saying… 

**Marco:** To make a mistake. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Let's listen to some examples of how this word is used. 

**Example One** 

> A: Jill, you really screwed up this time, you're fired. 

**Example Two** 

> B: This game is important. If you screw it up, we're out of the finals. 

**Example Three** 

> C: I'm sorry, I know I screwed up. Will you forgive me? 

**Marco:** Okay, so, screw up is mess up. 

**Erica:** Yeah, make a mistake. 

**Marco:** Make a mistake. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Great! And our last word on fluency builder today – a beer run. 

**Erica:** A beer run.

**Marco:** You run to get beer. Hehe.

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Get more beer.
