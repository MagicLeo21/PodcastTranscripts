## New Guy In Town II

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** Today we're bringing you Part II of another great lesson that we had. 

**Erica:** Yes! New Guy In Town. 

**Marco:** The Ney Guy In Town. 

**Erica:** Part Two. 

**Marco:** Part Two. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Kind of a creepy story. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Yeah, and this one is also a little bit strange, a little bit weird. 

**Erica:** Yeah, unusual outcome, unusual ending. 

**Marco:** But it has to do a lot with invitations. 

**Erica:** That's right, so, an invitation is when you ask somebody to do something with you. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** A dinner invitation. 

**Erica:** So, we're gonna be talking about invitations and inviting people to do things. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Well, with that, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

> A: Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation! It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner, don't you think so, Ellen?

> B: Oh, yes of course! We'd love to come over. Can I bring anything?

> C: No, don't worry about it; I'll take care of everything. I'll see you tonight. Come with an appetite… I know I will!

> B: I don't want go over to his place for dinner! He gives me the creeps! Why on earth did you accept?

> A: Oh come on Ellen, it will be nice to get to know him. Besides, he's new to the neighborhood, and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

> B: I guess so… You always rope me into things like this!

> C: Ladies! Thank you for coming! You look delicious…I mean beautiful. Please come in.

> A: Oh Oh Armand! You are too kind!

> B: How did I get myself into this…

**Marco:** Wow! I'm really anxious to see what happens in… in this dinner party. 

**Erica:** Yeah, I guess we'll have to stay tuned and find out… 

**Marco:** For Part Three. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, well, we have some really great vocabulary, so, I guess we can start with "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Alright, on language takeaway today we have three great words, uh, Erica, why don't you start it soft with the first one? 

**Erica:** The first word is thoughtful. 

**Marco:** Thoughtful. 

**Erica:** Thoughtful. 

**Marco:** Thoughtful. 

**Erica:** So, when you're thoughtful, you're… kind, right? 

**Marco:** You're kind, you're considerate… 

**Erica:** Yes, you… 

**Marco:** To other people. 

**Erica:** You think about what the other person would like. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** And you do that thing. 

**Marco:** It's so thoughtful of you. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Our second phrase – give me the creeps. 

**Erica:** Give me the creeps. 

**Marco:** Give me the creeps. 

**Erica:** This is kind of a funny phrase, but I think if we listen to some examples, we'll understand the meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: Horror movies give me the creeps. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Stop it! You're giving me the creeps. 

**Example Three** 

> C: I saw this really scary clown; he gave me the creeps. 

**Erica:** So, I can see this one means to make me feel uncomfortable. 

**Marco:** Right, it makes me feel… 

**Erica:** Like strange… 

**Marco:** Scared… 

**Erica:** Yeah, scared. 

**Marco:** Also. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Gives me the creeps. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And our last phrase for language takeaway – rope me into. 

**Erica:** Rope me into something. 

**Marco:** Rope me into something. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, if you rope me into something, it's… 

**Erica:** It's like you convince me to do something that I don't really wanna do. 

**Marco:** Right, so, I roped you into landing me your car. 

**Erica:** Yes, it was a bad idea. 

**Marco:** That was a bad idea. 

**Erica:** And you roped me into going out for beers after work. 

**Marco:** Yeah, that was a great idea. 

**Erica:** Mmm. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, so, rope me into. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Convince. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, I guess we could listen to our dialogue again. 

**Erica:** This time a little bit slower and you'll be able to understand the language a little bit more clearly. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

> A: Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation! It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner, don't you think so, Ellen?

> B: Oh, yes of course! We'd love to come over. Can I bring anything?

> C: No, don't worry about it; I'll take care of everything. I'll see you tonight. Come with an appetite… I know I will!

> B: I don't want go over to his place for dinner! He gives me the creeps! Why on earth did you accept?

> A: Oh come on Ellen, it will be nice to get to know him. Besides, he's new to the neighborhood, and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

> B: I guess so… You always rope me into things like this!

> C: Ladies! Thank you for coming! You look delicious…I mean beautiful. Please come in.

> A: Oh Oh Armand! You are too kind!

> B: How did I get myself into this…

**Marco:** Well, I guess that's a lot more clearer and with that we can start "putting it together" today. 

**Putting It Together** 

**Erica:** Today we've got three words and phrases that we wanna show you how you can put together and use differently. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** The first one is appetite. 

**Marco:** Appetite. 

**Erica:** Appetite. 

**Marco:** Appetite. 

**Erica:** So, appetite is like, ah, a strong desire for food, right? 

**Marco:** Right, an appetite. 

**Erica:** We've got some examples that show you how to use this phrase; let's listen. 

**Example One** 

> A: Mmm, dinner smells so good; it's giving me an appetite. 

**Example Two** 

> B: You're sure eating a lot; you must have a big appetite. 

**Example Three** 

> C: I'm getting sick; I have a fever and I've lost my appetite. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, we saw some great examples of appetite. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** You can lose your appetite. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** You have a big appetite. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Small appetite. 

**Erica:** A healthy appetite. 

**Marco:** Right, so, it just means… 

**Erica:** A desire for food. 

**Marco:** Desire for foods. 

**Erica:** A hunger for food. Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. Great, what's our second phrase for today? 

**Erica:** Get to know someone. 

**Marco:** Get to know. 

**Erica:** Get to know. 

**Marco:** So, when you get to know someone is you talk to them and you find out what they do. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you get more familiar with them. 

**Marco:** More familiar, right. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** For example, we can say "I got to know her in Spanish class and she's a really nice person". 

**Erica:** Yeah, or you can say "Armand, Ellen and Doris got to know each other at a dinner party". 

**Marco:** Right, or you can say "if you get to know me, you'll see that I'm not a bad guy". 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** That's true. 

**Marco:** Okay, get to know. 

**Erica:** And our third phrase is why on earth. 

**Marco:** Why on earth. 

**Erica:** Why on earth. 

**Marco:** Why on earth. This is the… uh, this is like a saying… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** ??? expression. 

**Erica:** And you can use it in a lot of different ways, so, we've got some examples for you; let's listen. 

**Example One** 

> A: Where on earth is my phone? 

**Example Two** 

> B: How on earth did you learn English in one month? 

**Example Three** 

> C: What on earth is it? 

**Erica:** So, when you ask a question with on earth - so, why on earth, how on earth, what on earth – it's like you're showing a lot of surprise. 

**Marco:** Okay, great stuff! So, let's just listen to our dialogue a third time. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

> A: Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation! It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner, don't you think so, Ellen?

> B: Oh, yes of course! We'd love to come over. Can I bring anything?

> C: No, don't worry about it; I'll take care of everything. I'll see you tonight. Come with an appetite… I know I will!

> B: I don't want go over to his place for dinner! He gives me the creeps! Why on earth did you accept?

> A: Oh come on Ellen, it will be nice to get to know him. Besides, he's new to the neighborhood, and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

> B: I guess so… You always rope me into things like this!

> C: Ladies! Thank you for coming! You look delicious…I mean beautiful. Please come in.

> A: Oh Oh Armand! You are too kind!

> B: How did I get myself into this…

**Marco:** We want to know what you think happens next. 

**Erica:** Yes, what happens in this dialogue next? 

**Marco:** So, we want you to send us your idea of what happens next and we're going to choose the best one. 

**Erica:** That's right, Marco and I will choose the best continuation of this story and we'll use that in Part Three of the New Guy In Town. 

**Marco:** That's right. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** So, you can give it any direction you want. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** And, of course, we'll publish the name of the author. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** With the lesson. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** I'm really anxious to see what ideas come up and how we can end this dialogue. 

**Erica:** I know we've got a lot of really creative users out there, so, I'm really looking forward to this.
