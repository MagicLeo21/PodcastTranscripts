## Out Of Control Spending

---

**Erica:** Hello everyone! And welcome to EnglishPod! My name's Erica. 

**Marco:** And I'm Marco. 

**Erica:** So, Marco, how're you doing today? 

**Marco:** I'm great! I'm really happy to be back, ready to deliver another great podcast for all our listeners. 

**Erica:** That's right! And we've got an intermediate lesson today about spending money. 

**Marco:** Yeah, specifically, spending money in a company. 

**Erica:** That's right, we're going to be listening to a business meeting as a company describes how they're spending money. 

**Marco:** Right, and they're actually looking at their profit and loss statement, so… 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** That's kind of interesting. 

**Erica:** Well, Marco, can you tell us a little bit about a profit and loss statement? 

**Marco:** Uh, yeah, sure! Well, all companies come out with a profit and loss statement every year or every three months and it's basically a document that shows all the money that the company is spending and all the money the money that the company is earning. 

**Erica:** So, it's a document that outlines how much money the company makes and how much it… it spends. 

**Marco:** Right, so, in the end, basically, it'll tell you we're making money or we're losing money. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, we're gonna be listening to, uh, some people discuss a profit and loss statement in just a moment. But before we do that, it's time for "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Marco:** Okay, great! So, today on our vocabulary preview we have two words for you, so, let's take a look at the first one. 

**Erica:** Expenses. 

**Marco:** Expenses. 

**Erica:** Expenses. 

**Marco:** Expenses. 

**Erica:** So, expenses are things that you have to spend money on regularly. 

**Marco:** Right, so, for example, in a company regular company expenses are salaries or office supplies or the phone bills, internet bills. 

**Erica:** Okay, and maybe in a household or a family your expenses might be your food, perhaps your transportation or your rent or your heating bills, so, these are all things you spend money on regularly. They're expenses. 

**Marco:** Expenses, great! Let's take a look at our second word – through the roof. 

**Erica:** Through the roof. 

**Marco:** Through the roof. 

**Erica:** Through the roof. 

**Marco:** So, when something is through the roof, it's… 

**Erica:** Really, really, really, really high. 

**Marco:** Really high. Hehe. So, for example, we can talk about gas prices are through the roof lately. 

**Erica:** Yeah, that's totally true. Gas prices have gone really high in the past couple of months. 

**Marco:** So, when we talk about through the roof, it means that the number is really high. 

**Erica:** That's right, we typically use this word with numbers. It also gives you the idea that the number has risen really quickly. 

**Marco:** Yeah, exactly! Hehe. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, through the roof. 

**Marco:** Through the roof. 

**Erica:** Alright, Marco, do you think it's time for the dialogue? 

**Marco:** Yup, let's listen to the dialogue. As always the first dialogue is gonna be a little bit fast, so, it might be a little bit difficult, but… 

**Erica:** Don't worry if you don't understand everything, because we will explain all the key language in a minute. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Erica:** Okay, so, this accountant, she is, uh, pretty thorough, hey? 

**Marco:** Hehe. She's really persistent about her job and the manager apparently is a little bit embarrassed. 

**Erica:** Hm, I wonder why that could be. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, we'll talk about that in a little while. Why don't we take a look at our language takeaway for today? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** In today's language takeaway we're going to look at three words and the first word is expenditures. 

**Marco:** Expenditures. 

**Erica:** Expenditures. 

**Marco:** Expenditures. 

**Erica:** So, expenditures sounds pretty close to expenses, right? 

**Marco:** It's pretty similar, but it has a little bit of a difference, so, why don't we listen to some examples and see if we can understand? 

**Example One** 

> A: ??? to president I will increase expenditures on health and education by twelve per cent 

(12%). 

**Example Two** 

> B: We really need to control our travel expenditures. From now on all managers will fly economy class. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Because of the rise in oil prices expenditures on food are higher than they have ever been. 

**Erica:** So, expenditures is the total amount of money that you're spending on something. 

**Marco:** Right, that's the total amount of money versus expenses is the things that you spend money on. 

**Erica:** Okay, that's really clear. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Our next word is out of control. 

**Marco:** Out of control. 

**Erica:** Out of control. 

**Marco:** So, when something is out of control, it's… 

**Erica:** It's crazy. 

**Marco:** Crazy, you can't control it. 

**Erica:** Exactly, you can't stop it. 

**Marco:** You can't stop it, right. 

**Erica:** Out of control. 

**Marco:** Okay, great! Now, let's take a look at our last word for today – go over. 

**Erica:** Go over. 

**Marco:** Go over. 

**Erica:** Go over. 

**Marco:** So, go over is a pretty simple word. Why don't we listen to some examples, so we can understand go over? 

**Example One** 

> A: I need to go over this report one last time to make sure there're no mistakes. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Can you help me go over my presentation? I want to make sure it's perfect. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Let's go over these numbers one more time and make sure there're no mistakes. 

**Erica:** Yeah, this is a really common word and it basically means "look at carefully". 

**Marco:** Yeah, or review. 

**Erica:** In English we often find simple little words, they fit together really well and you think "Oh, they're so easy". Like the word go, over. So easy. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Yeah. 

**Erica:** But it's the way that they interact with each other that makes them… 

**Marco:** Or it makes you sound much better. 

**Erica:** Exactly, so, go over in this case, we might say, um "Let's go over the lesson". 

**Marco:** Let's go over the lesson, yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or… 

**Erica:** That sounds great. 

**Marco:** Yeah, that's… and that's more, uh, natural way of saying something like that. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, we've taken look at our language takeaways for today. I think it's time to listen to the dialogue one more time. 

**Marco:** And this time the dialogue will be slower, so we can understand and listen to all the words we just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Okay, so, I got it. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's clear now. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and you know, I heard a lot of really great phrases in this dialogue that I'd like to at now in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** Great, so, today on fluency builder we have three words for you. Let's start by looking at the first one – off the charts. 

**Erica:** Off the charts. 

**Marco:** Off the charts. 

**Erica:** Off the charts. 

**Marco:** So, this word is very similar to through the roof. 

**Erica:** Exactly, it also means really high. 

**Marco:** Right, so, let's listen to some examples of how we can use off the charts in a different situation. 

**Example One** 

> A: Oil prices have gone up and our costs are off the charts. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Excellent job Susan! Your sales are off the charts this year. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Our losses are off the charts! That's it! No bonuses for anyone! 

**Erica:** So, Marco, do you think I can change off the charts for through the roof in these examples? 

**Marco:** Yeah, you can. Definitely, you can use off the charts or through the roof, both of them mean the same thing. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, two ways of saying really, really, really high. 

**Marco:** Really high. But they're very commonly used in a business setting. 

**Erica:** Yeah, that's true. Okay, so, this next word is a phrase that you can use if you want to tell somebody that you'll check something or you'll investigate something. 

**Marco:** Right, and we heard it in our dialogue, so, let's listen to the clip. 

> Phrase 1: I'll look into it. I'll look into it. 

**Erica:** So, look into that that means I'll check something. 

**Marco:** Yeah, I'll see what's happening. 

**Erica:** Yeah, does that mean you're gonna take action? 

**Marco:** No, it doesn't. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, I think we've got another word that does mean you're going to take action. 

> Phrase 2: I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it. 

**Marco:** So, this word means that you're going to do something about it. 

**Erica:** I'll take care of it. I will take responsibility. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, I will do something about it. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I will investigate and I'll do it. 

**Erica:** Yeah, ex… again, two great phrases – I'll look into it; I'll take care of it. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, now let's listen to the dialogue a third time. It's gonna be at its normal speed, but now you have all the tools you need to understand it a lot better. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Erica:** Well, Marco, I guess one of the benefits of being an executive in a company, especially a large company, is you get a lot of amazing benefits. 

**Marco:** Yes, when you are a manger or a CEO of one of these big companies, you get a lot of great things like… I don't know, a private jet, maybe… 

**Erica:** Wow, that's… that's nice, hey? 

**Marco:** Hehe. Or, um, they… um, the company often pays for your house… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or for your car, they'll give you a company car. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Um, they'll pay for your kids or your children's, uh, tuition for high school. 

**Erica:** So, there're school fees. 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** And also I've heard about entertainment bonuses. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, you can go out to a restaurant, get the receipt and claim the expenses at work. 

**Marco:** Hah, those are some great benefits, right? 

**Erica:** So, Marco, I'm curious to know what our listeners' expenses are. 

**Marco:** Yes, we definitely want to know what crazy expenses you have, for example… 

**Erica:** Well, let's see, my spending on coke zero has gone through the roof since we started this podcast. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Yes, you spend a lot of money on coke zeros every week, right? 

**Erica:** Uh, yeah, I probably have, uh… I don't know, ten a week. 

**Marco:** Well, for examples, I spend, uh, a lot on DVDs each week. I usually buy two or three movies. 

**Erica:** That is off the charts. 

**Marco:** Hehe. That is off the charts for DVD spending. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, we want to know what you spend your money on, be sure to l… go into our community website and tell us what you spend money on.
