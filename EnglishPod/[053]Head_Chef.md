**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're back bringing you another great lesson, ah, an intermediate lesson. 

**Erica:** That's right, about one of my favorite subjects. 

**Marco:** We're talking about food. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Hehe. So, on this occasion we're gonna be talking about food, so, let's preview some words on "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Alright, we have three words for you today. Um, and the first word is head chef. 

**Marco:** Head chef. 

**Erica:** Head chef. 

**Marco:** So, what is a head chef? 

**Erica:** Well, in a professional kitchen, um, this is the boss of the kitchen or the leader of the kitchen. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, the head chief is the… the main cook… 

**Erica:** Yes, but… 

**Marco:** Sort of saying. 

**Erica:** He doesn't cook 

**Marco:** He… but he doesn't cook. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Alright, so if he doesn't cook, who's the one that… does the cooking? 

**Erica:** Um, that brings us to our second word, sous chef. 

**Marco:** Sous chef. 

**Erica:** Sous chef. 

**Marco:** Sous chef. 

**Erica:** S-O-U-S. 

**Marco:** So, the S is silent. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Because it's like a French word. 

**Erica:** Yeah, something like that. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, the sous chef is the second in line to the head chef. 

**Erica:** Yea, he's the number two. 

**Marco:** Number two. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, he's basically the one that's doing some of the work. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** In the kitchen. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Now, let's take a look at our last word, cuisine. 

**Erica:** Cuisine. 

**Marco:** Cuisine. 

**Erica:** Cuisine. 

**Marco:** So, this is an interesting word. What exactly does it mean? 

**Erica:** Well, it basically means, um, cooking, right? 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Like the art of cooking. 

**Marco:** So, for example, I can say French food. 

**Erica:** Yeah, or French cuisine. 

**Marco:** French cuisine, which includes all the food. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** And this also the major that people study in college… 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** To become a chief. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** They study cuisine. 

**Erica:** Uhu. And cuisine is a noun, right? 

**Marco:** It's a noun. Okay, so I think we're ready to dive into our dialogue. What exactly is going on? 

**Erica:** Well, um, we're in a restaurant, um, and it's a really busy night and so, we're going to listen to what is happening in the kitchen. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, a busy night here at this restaurant. 

**Erica:** I know, it sounds like, ah, there's a lot of pressure on this chief, Jean Pierre. 

**Marco:** Yeah. Hehe. Yeah, you can… you can tell in his voice that he's really stressed out. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's take a look at some of this kitchen vocabulary that we found, ah, in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, well, we've got five words for you today, ah, and the first one is peel. 

**Marco:** Peel. 

**Erica:** Peel. 

**Marco:** Peel. 

**Erica:** P-E-E-L. 

**Marco:** So, this is a verb. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And it means to… 

**Erica:** Remove the outside skin. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, for example, when you're gonna eat a banana. 

**Erica:** You must peel it first. 

**Marco:** You must peel it. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** You gotta take away the yellow skin. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** What else do you peel? Oranges, potatoes. 

**Erica:** Potatoes, like in the dialogue. Ah, what else can you peel? I don't know, carrots. 

**Marco:** Carrots. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Some people peel their tomatoes I don't know why. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it is kind of weird. 

**Marco:** Alright, now let's take a look at our next word, chop. 

**Erica:** Chop. 

**Marco:** Chop. 

**Erica:** Chop. 

**Marco:** So, again another verb and it means to… 

**Erica:** It means to cut food in to pieces. 

**Marco:** Oh… so if you're gonna eat carrots, first you gotta chop them. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Right, you can't put a whole carrot in… 

**Erica:** In you soup. 

**Marco:** In your soup… 

**Erica:** No 

**Marco:** Or in your rice. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, chop. 

**Erica:** M… 

**Marco:** Okay our next word, stirred. 

**Erica:** Yeah, this is the past participle of the word stir. 

**Marco:** Okay, so the verb stir. 

**Erica:** Stir. 

**Marco:** So, when you stir something… 

**Erica:** Imagine you have a big pot. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Um, and you've got a long spoon, you move the spoon around in circles. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, you're stirring the pot. 

**Marco:** You're mixing. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** To stir is very similar to mix. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So you just move the food around. 

**Marco:** Move the food around. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, our next word, butchered. 

**Erica:** Again the past participle of the word butcher. 

**Marco:** Okay, butcher. 

**Erica:** Butcher. 

**Marco:** Now, this is a verb to butcher something. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** It's when you remove all the bones and all the organs from the meat. 

**Erica:** Exactly, so you cut up the meat. 

**Marco:** And this is interesting because that's also a noun. 

**Erica:** Right, a butcher is the person who cuts up meat. 

**Marco:** Okay, so… so it's really easy, a butcher butchers meat. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, our last word, buttered. 

**Erica:** Buttered. 

**Marco:** Buttered. 

**Erica:** Buttered. 

**Marco:** Okay, so buttered, this is weird. 

**Erica:** I know, um, normally we all know the… the noun, butter. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** But here it's acting as a verb. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, when you butter something, you spread or put butter on it. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Simple. 

**Marco:** So, to put butter on something. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** So you can butter a piece of bread. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Or in this case the fish is being buttered. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Sounds delicious. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, now we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the second time, we're gonna slow it down a little bit so it's easier to understand. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Okay, so that seems to be a little bit better. 

**Erica:** Uhu. And, hey, I noticed that there's a lot of really great kitchen words in here like words that you commonly hear in a professional kitchen. 

**Marco:** Okay. So let's take a look at these kitchen words in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** Alright, we've got three phrases, ah, and the first one is in the weeds. 

**Marco:** In the weeds. 

**Erica:** In the weeds. 

**Marco:** In the weeds. 

**Erica:** So, when you in the weeds, you're so so busy and you can't do all the work you need to do on time. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, in the weeds, it means that you're really busy. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And… 

**Erica:** You can't finish everything. 

**Marco:** And you can't… you have too much to do. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, in the weeds. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, our next word, running low on. 

**Erica:** Running low on. 

**Marco:** Running low on. 

**Erica:** Running low on. 

**Marco:** Okay, so before we get into explaining what running lo on means, let's listen to some examples. 

**Example One** 

> A: You'd better look for a gas station, we're running low on fuel. 

**Example Two** 

> B: We're running low on beers. Can you go out and get some? 

**Example Three** 

> C: My flashlight is running low on battery, hurry up before gets dark. 

**Marco:** So basically running low means… 

**Erica:** Um, you don't have much of this left. 

**Marco:** You don't have much of something left. 

**Erica:** Yep, so here they're running low on wine, so basically… 

**Marco:** There's no much wine left. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** So as we've heard in the examples you could also be running low on fuel, for example. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** On your car… 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Etcetera. Running low on. Alright and now let's take a look at our last word. Doing really well. 

**Erica:** Doing really well. 

**Marco:** We are doing really well. 

**Erica:** Doing really well. So, that seems to be like a pretty simple structure, I mean we know all this words, right? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** So, why is it special? 

**Marco:** Well, basically, if you say I'm doing really well, maybe it sounds a little bit difficult to understand, what are you doing really well? 

**Erica:** Uh. 

**Marco:** So, this is a great way of answering a question when somebody says "how are you?" or "how are you doing?" you can say "oh, I'm doing really well". 

**Erica:** So… 

**Marco:** Or "I'm doing well". 

**Erica:** In your life everything is good. 

**Marco:** In your life thing are good and you're happy basically. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but in this situation, in the dialogue, what's doing really well? 

**Marco:** Well, the restaurant is doing really well, the business is doing really well. 

**Erica:** So when he says we're doing really well, um, business is… 

**Marco:** Good. 

**Erica:** Good, they're making lots of money. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So you can use it with people, you can use it with businesses, you can say "oh, I'm doing really well in my new job". 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Or "my son is doing really well in school". 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you can use in… in those different ways. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, let's listen to the dialogue, ah, one last time and we'll be able to hear all of these great words and phrases we've just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Erica:** So, Marco, do you think this chief had a rat under his hat? 

**Marco:** Hehe. That was a really good movie. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Ratatouille. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Disney-Pixar. 

**Erica:** Uh. 

**Marco:** Where the rat is a cook. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** It's interesting I love to cook but I'm not very good at cooking. 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** But it's good because for me… it helps me relieve stress. 

**Erica:** Me too, actually, you know, if I'm in a bad mood I go home and cook something to eat and… the world seems a happier place. 

**Marco:** Hehe. And people don't understand because they think cooking is work.
