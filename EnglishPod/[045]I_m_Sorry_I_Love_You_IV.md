## I m Sorry, I Love You IV

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you part four of our romantic series called I'm Sorry, I Love You. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and today we've got some drama, don't we? 

**Marco:** We got a lot of drama and we got a lot of useful language. 

**Erica:** Yeah, we're gonna learn, um, some phrases we can use to describe a mistake. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And, uh, we're also going to learn how we can comfort someone, we can make them feel better. 

**Marco:** Okay, exactly, so, in our dialogue today Veronica and her boyfriend are on a break. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** So, what does it mean to be on a break? 

**Erica:** Well, it means you stop having a romantic relationship for a short time. 

**Marco:** So, you can say "We are on a break". 

**Erica:** So, we're not dating. 

**Marco:** We're not dating. 

**Erica:** But… 

**Marco:** Oh… 

**Erica:** We don't date. 

**Marco:** Oh… Hehe. Or we could say "Let's take a break". 

**Erica:** Right, so, we've got this state on a break and the action take a break. 

**Marco:** Take a break. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's take a break. Okay, so, let's listen to our dialogue and it's gonna be a little bit fast and the girl, I think, she's crying, so, it'll be a little bit difficult to understand. 

**Erica:** But Marco and I will come back in a minute and we'll talk about some of the difficult language here. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Wow, that's a romantic boyfriend singing in the street. 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah, that's amazing. Have you… Have you ever done that for a girl? 

**Marco:** Uh… no. Hehe. 

**Erica:** Hehe. Well, have you… have you ever sung to a girl on KTV. 

**Marco:** I've sung to a girl on KTV. 

**Erica:** And karaoke. 

**Marco:** Karaoke, yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, but not so much as on… on the street with all the neighbors coming out to see me. 

**Erica:** Well, okay, well, I don't blame you. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, let's take a look at the language that we saw in our dialogue on "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, let's take a look at our first word – seeing someone. 

**Erica:** Seeing someone. 

**Marco:** Seeing someone. 

**Erica:** Seeing someone. 

**Marco:** So, if I'm seeing someone… 

**Erica:** You're dating them. 

**Marco:** I'm dating them. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I'm frequently going out with that person. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** So, but it's not very serious. 

**Erica:** N… No… it is serious. 

**Marco:** But not really, it's more of a casual thing. It's not very exclusive. 

**Erica:** So… So, if you're seeing someone, then you can also s… see another person. 

**Marco:** Maybe. 

**Erica:** Hm. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Well, I think sometimes seeing someone can mean actually they're your boyfriend or girlfriend. Like, I'm seeing John, he is my boyfriend. 

**Marco:** Okay, yeah, see, this is the difficult thing about seeing someone is that for some people it means it's really serious, while for other people it means it's more casual. 

**Erica:** I guess it's important that you and your boyfriend of girlfriend share the same view on the meaning of this word. 

**Marco:** Alright. Have to agree on what seeing someone means. 

**Erica:** Okay, well, what's our next word, Marco? 

**Marco:** Cheating on. 

**Erica:** Cheating on someone. 

**Marco:** Cheating on me. 

**Erica:** Cheating on someone. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, if you're cheating on someone… 

**Erica:** Then you are like kissing or even having sex with someone, who's not your boyfriend or your husband, or your girlfriend or your wife. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** If I say "She cheated on me"… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** That means that my girlfriend kissed of had sex with another guy. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** But if I say "She cheated me"… 

**Erica:** Yeah, that' different. 

**Marco:** That's different, right? 

**Erica:** It's different. Maybe she sold you something for a really high price. 

**Marco:** She cheated me. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or maybe she sold me something that was fake. 

**Erica:** Or, yeah… or broken or something. 

**Marco:** Or broken. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, so… 

**Erica:** So, cheated on is really different from cheated. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's take a look at our next word – messed this up. 

**Erica:** Messed this up. 

**Marco:** Messed this up. 

**Erica:** Messed this up. So, Marco, this is a phrasal verb, um, and that means we can sort of switch it around a little bit, right? 

**Marco:** Exactly, why don't we listen to some examples and then we can come back and talk some more. 

**Example One** 

> A: I messed up on the examen and now I passed my class. 

**Example Two** 

> B: When I'm cooking I always mess up and burn the rice. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, messed up, it's pretty clear I think. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, let's take a look at our next word – amateur. 

**Erica:** Amateur. 

**Marco:** Amateur. 

**Erica:** Amateur. 

**Marco:** So, when someone is amateur… 

**Erica:** They're acting really young. 

**Marco:** Really young, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** But it's not a very good thing to be amateur. 

**Erica:** No, it's… it has a negative meaning. 

**Marco:** Right, it's normal for children to be amateur. 

**Erica:** Cause they're children. 

**Marco:** Right, but not an adult. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, we've got some examples that will help you to understand this word a little bit better. 

**Example One** 

> A: Your toilet jokes are not funny. Stop being so amateur. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Jenny acts like she's sixteen. She's so amateur. 

**Example Three** 

> C: God, you and your friends always act so amateur. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, amateur. Now, let's take a look at our next word – selfish. 

**Erica:** Selfish. 

**Marco:** Selfish. 

**Erica:** Selfish. 

**Marco:** So, a selfish person… 

**Erica:** Is a person, who only thinks about themselves. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I only think about me. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** No one else. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you don't care about other people's feelings. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, it's not a good think to be amateur or selfish. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again. We're gonna slow it down a little bit. 

**Erica:** And this will help you to understand these phrases a little bit more clearly. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Okay, so, we saw Veronica's friend trying to calm her down, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, trying to comfort her. 

**Marco:** Okay, to make her feel better. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Let's take a look at some of the phrases she used in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, what was the first phrase that she said? 

**Erica:** Everything is going to work out just fine. 

**Marco:** Everything is going to work out just fine. 

**Erica:** Everything is gonna work out just fine. 

**Marco:** What does that mean? 

**Erica:** It's going to be okay. 

**Marco:** It's going to be okay, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, the problem will be solved. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, if somebody's worried or somebody is crying, you… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** You can say "Oh, don't worry, everything is going to work out just fine". 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay. Okay, let's look at the next one - pull yourself together. 

**Erica:** Pull yourself together. 

**Marco:** Pull yourself together. 

**Erica:** Pull yourself together. 

**Marco:** So, what does that mean, exactly? It sounds kind of weird. 

**Erica:** I know, I guess it… it just means stop crying, relax and, you know, take a deep breath. 

**Marco:** Okay. Just like calm down. 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Marco:** Get organized. 

**Erica:** Yeah-yeah-yeah. 

**Marco:** With your ideas and your thoughts. 

**Erica:** Yeah. So, you can think of maybe somebody, who's got tears down their face and everything is sort of in a mess. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** If you pull it together, they clean up and they… 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** They sort of relax, right? 

**Marco:** Okay. Pull yourself together. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright, and the last phrase that we saw – it's going to be alright. 

**Erica:** It's going to be alright. 

**Marco:** It's going to be alright. 

**Erica:** It's going to be alright. 

**Marco:** So, it's going to be alright means everything is going to be okay. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's going to be fine. 

**Marco:** It's going to be fine. 

**Erica:** The problem will go away. 

**Marco:** You… 

**Erica:** You'll feel better. 

**Marco:** Maybe you can even say "It'll be alright". 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Marco:** It'll be alright. 

**Erica:** Yeah. These are three really helpful phrases that you can use when you wanna say something nice to a friend or a colleague, who… who has a problem. 

**Marco:** Okay, exactly, very useful language. So, let's listen to some more examples. 

**Example One** 

> A: Don't worry, everything is going to work out just fine. I'm sure he still loves you. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Everything is gonna be alright. We'll find your puppy. Don't worry! 

**Marco:** Okay, great examples and I think it's clear now. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and talk some more. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, I really like this dialogue. It's so romantic. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** It's drama, but at the same time romantic. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, we want to know what you think will happen next? 

**Erica:** Yeah, will they get back together? 

**Marco:** Will they get married? 

**Erica:** Will the have a baby? 

**Marco:** Maybe they'll break up for ever. 

**Erica:** Maybe she'll move halfway across the world. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Anything can happen, so, let us know what you think will happen. 

**Erica:** Uhu, come to our website at englishpod.com and leave your comments on the lesson page. 

**Marco:** Exactly, and maybe you'll be right. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you never know. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, we're out of time for today. I hope you guys had fun and we'll see you next time. Until then it's… 

**Erica:** Good bye! 

**Marco:** Bye!
