## I'm Sorry, I Love You III

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you the Third Part of this series that we've created, called I'm Sorry, I Love You. 

**Erica:** That's right, the third part in our story about our EnglishPod couple. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's a romantic series, but today we're bringing you an argument. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** Like in every relationship you have fights, you have discussions. So, we're gonna teach you how to do that in English. 

**Erica:** That's right, in today's lesson you'll learn some great language that people use when they get into an argument with their boyfriend or girlfriend. 

**Marco:** Right, so, why don't we take a look at "vocabulary preview"? 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** We have one phrase today – get a hold. 

**Marco:** Get a hold. 

**Erica:** Get a hold. 

**Marco:** To get a hold. 

**Erica:** To get a hold of someone means… 

**Marco:** To try and communicate with that person. 

**Erica:** Exactly. So, to try and call that person. 

**Marco:** For example, I can say "I've been calling his phone all day, but I can't get a hold of him". 

**Erica:** Or I could say "finally, Marco, I got a hold of you; where have you been all day?" 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Now, we're gonna listen to our dialogue and as always it's gonna be at a normal pace, but you don't have to worry about it. 

**Erica:** We'll come back and teach you all of the important words. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, a little bit of trouble in the relationship. 

**Erica:** Yeah, that's too bad. 

**Marco:** Yeah, well, I think, um, she's overreacting. 

**Erica:** You do? 

**Marco:** Hehe. We'll talk about that later on. But we saw some great words and phrases here, so it's time for "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Today on language takeaway we're bringing you three words. 

**Erica:** The first word is stood me up. 

**Marco:** Stood me up. 

**Erica:** Stood me up. 

**Marco:** Stood me up. 

**Erica:** The phrase stand someone up, when do we use this? 

**Marco:** If, for example, you have a date and you don't go. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, let's say you and I were supposed to have dinner together. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** And you just didn't come. 

**Marco:** Right, and didn't… 

**Erica:** And didn't call. 

**Marco:** Right, so, I stood you up. 

**Erica:** Yeah, okay. 

**Marco:** Stand someone up. 

**Erica:** Our next word – priorities. 

**Marco:** Priorities. 

**Erica:** Priorities. 

**Marco:** So, priorities are something that's really important in your life. 

**Erica:** That's right like family or maybe work or making a lot of money. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Or whatever it is. 

**Marco:** Wh… What are your priorities in life? Right? 

**Erica:** Right, yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. And our last word for language takeaway – heading. 

**Erica:** Heading. 

**Marco:** Heading. 

**Erica:** Heading. This is a bit of a funny verb, so let's listen to a couple of examples of how it's used, so we can understand its meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: I don't know where our relationship is heading. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Where's this bus heading? 

**Example Three** 

> C: Where's this project heading? 

**Marco:** So, basically heading means going. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** A heading is where you're going. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, easy word and interesting. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, so now it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time. It's gonna be slower, so now we can understand the words that we just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Okay, now, we saw some interesting phrases in the dialogue. 

**Erica:** Yeah, we saw some great phrases, uh, that people use when they're getting in a fight. 

**Marco:** Right. Why don't we take a look at some of them in "fluency builder"? 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** The first phrase that I wanna take a look at today is do you have any idea. 

**Erica:** Do you have any idea. 

**Marco:** Do you have any idea. 

**Erica:** This is a great way to set up an argument. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to some examples of how you would set up an argument using this phrase. 

**Example One** 

> A: You forgot my birthday. Do you have any idea how angry I am? 

**Example Two** 

> B: Julie kissed my boyfriend. Does she have any idea how mean that was? 

**Example Three** 

> C: I just broke up with my boyfriend. Don't you have any idea how sad I am? 

**Marco:** So, it's a great phrase to make that person understand that you're really worried or… 

**Erica:** Really angry. 

**Marco:** Really angry. 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. Another second phrase that you can take a look at is I've heard it all before. 

**Erica:** I heard it all before. 

**Marco:** I've heard it all before. 

**Erica:** I've heard it all before. 

**Marco:** So, this is a great phrase of just saying "you don't have to give me an excuse; I know what you're gonna say". 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** And our last phrase today – take a break. 

**Erica:** Take a break. 

**Marco:** Take a break. 

**Erica:** So, when a couple takes a break, they sort of… stop their relationship, right? 

**Marco:** Right, they're breaking up. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but it's… is it really like forever? Like, uh, a break up that lasts forever? 

**Marco:** Not, well… maybe. It could be forever, but they're saying let's just take some time away from each other… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** For a couple of days or weeks… 

**Erica:** Yeah-yeah. 

**Marco:** And see what happens. 

**Erica:** Yes, take a break. 

**Marco:** Take a break. Okay, so, our happy couple is going to take a break. 

**Erica:** Well, I guess they're not that happy then, hey? 

**Marco:** Yeah. Hehe. Okay, so, let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and talk some more. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Erica:** So, Marco, this phrase to take a break really reminds me of a Friends episode. 

**Marco:** Yeah, that really famous Friends episode, when Ross and Rachel were on a break… 

**Erica:** And… 

**Marco:** And… 

**Erica:** And Ross like went with another girl, right? 

**Marco:** Yeah-yeah-yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And then they definitely broke up after that. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, that's one of the key issues, right? 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** If you're taking a break, can you start to date someone else? 

**Erica:** I've got to agree with Rachel. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Really? 

**Erica:** Yeah. No, you can't. You can't. 

**Marco:** You can't? 

**Erica:** Cause… 

**Marco:** So, what's the point of taking a break? 

**Erica:** Just… you need some time away; you need some time to think. 

**Marco:** But you're not really broken up. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Hm, that's convenient. 

**Erica:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** I don't know. They were on a break, I agree with Ross. 

**Erica:** Well… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** You would, wouldn't you? 

**Marco:** Alright guys, we're out of time today. I hope you enjoyed our lesson and be sure to listen next time, because we will definitely have a part four of this. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Coming out soon. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** And also come to our website at englishpod.com and leave all your questions and comments. 

**Erica:** Yeah, Marco and I are always happy to hear from you and we love answering your questions. 

**Marco:** Right, and maybe you can tell us what you think happens in the fourth part. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, well, until then it's… 

**Erica:** Good bye! 

**Marco:** Bye!
