## Virus!

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** Hey Erica, how are you today? 

**Erica:** Marco, I'm doing really well and I'm really looking forward to today's lesson. 

**Marco:** Well, so am I, because here at EnglishPod we're giving you real English. 

**Erica:** Everyday English. 

**Marco:** Exactly, English that you hear in movies or in TV-shows. 

**Erica:** This is English people actually use. 

**Marco:** So, Erica, what is our topic for today? 

**Erica:** Well, today we're talking about computer viruses. 

**Marco:** Perfect! So, I think it's time for us to take a look at our preview. 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Okay, today we've got two words to preview. The first word is virus. 

**Marco:** Virus. 

**Erica:** Virus. 

**Marco:** Virus. 

**Erica:** So, if your computer has a computer virus, it means your computer is sick, right? 

**Marco:** Actually, a computer virus is a program that is designed to harm or to damage your computer. 

**Erica:** Oh, I see, okay… 

**Marco:** And… 

**Erica:** Well, thank you for being so technical. 

**Marco:** Hehe. That's the technical explanation. Okay, let's take a look at our second word for our preview today and that would be froze. 

**Erica:** Froze. 

**Marco:** Froze. 

**Erica:** Froze. 

**Marco:** So, if your computer froze, it means that… 

**Erica:** Your computer stopped working. 

**Marco:** Your applications or your programs stop working and you just can't do anything. 

**Erica:** Your computer's broken. 

**Marco:** Okay, great, so, let's listen to our dialogue. It's gonna be a little bit fast, but… 

**Erica:** Don't worry if you don't understand everything. At the end of this podcast you'll understand everything. 

**Marco:** Perfect! Let's listen. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Well, I completely understand this guy. When my computer freezes I kick it and punch it and do everything to it. 

**Erica:** Well, I hope you don't punch it too hard, Marco. 

**Marco:** Well, it's still working, so it's alright. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Alright, let's take look at our "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** In today's language takeaway we have two words. The first word for today is infected file. 

**Marco:** Infected file. 

**Erica:** Infected file. 

**Marco:** Infected file. And what is an infected file? 

**Erica:** An infected file is a file in your computer that has a virus in it. 

**Marco:** Uh, perfect, that's really clear! What is our second word for the language takeaway today? 

**Erica:** Our second word is not up to date. 

**Marco:** Not up to date. 

**Erica:** Note up to date. 

**Marco:** And what is it when something is not up to date? 

**Erica:** It means it doesn't have all the most recent information. 

**Marco:** Okay, perfect! Now, let's listen to some examples. 

**Example One** 

> A: I need to buy a new computer, because mine isn't up to date. 

**Example Two** 

> B: I can't find this street. Are you sure this map is up to date? 

**Example Three** 

> C: Sarah has just finished the report and all the information is up to date. 

**Erica:** Okay, that was pretty clear. You know, you can also use this phrase positively. You can say up to date. 

**Marco:** Okay, for example, we can say "this is a new map, this the most up to date map". 

**Erica:** Exactly, or if I bought a new computer, I could say "I just got a new computer, all my software is up to date". 

**Marco:** Okay, great! So, now let's take a look at some phrases. 

**Erica:** And it's time for "putting it all together". 

**Putting It Together** 

**Erica:** Okay, so, Samuel said a really great phrase. He said I'll be right up. 

**Marco:** I'll be right up. 

**Erica:** I'll be right up. 

**Marco:** I'll be right up. Now, we can use this phrase in a lot of different situations, so, let's listen to some examples. 

**Example One** 

> A: Can you help me with my computer? 

> B: I'll be right there. 

**Example Two** 

> C: Come downstairs. Dinner is ready. 

> D: I'll be right down! 

**Example Three** 

> E: Hurry up! I need to use the bathroom! 

> F: I'll be right out! 

**Marco:** Okay, really great and clear examples, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, you know that phrase "I'll be right out"? I used to hear this all the time when I was young. 

**Marco:** Really? How come? 

**Erica:** Well, I have two sisters and we were always fighting for the bathroom, so, someone was always saying "Just a minute! I'll be right out!" 

**Marco:** Uh, yes, that's common. I had that too when I was young. Okay, now our second phrase is it turns out that. 

**Erica:** It turns out that. 

**Marco:** It turns out that. 

**Erica:** It turns out that. This is a great phrase, you can use it in many different satiations. Marco, can you give us an example? 

**Marco:** Sure! For example, I can say "Frank didn't come to work today and it turns out that he was sick". 

**Erica:** Yep! Or I could say "Oh, I've been feeling really sick recently and it…" 

**Marco:** Why? 

**Erica:** "It turns out that I'm pregnant". 

**Marco:** Oh, my God! Are you really pregnant? 

**Erica:** No, I'm not, Marco, I'm just kidding. 

**Marco:** Alright, because… Okay, so, it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again, but this time it'll be… 

**Erica:** A little bit slower. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Okay, that was a lot more clear this time. 

**Marco:** Definitely, yeah, I understood a lot more. Okay, so, now it's time to look at "fluency builder". Erica, why don't you explain what fluency builder is? 

**Erica:** In fluency builder we give you some great useful phrases to help you express your ideas clearly. 

**Marco:** Okay, great, so, let's look at fluency builder. 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** Okay, so, in this dialogue we know his computer wasn't working. 

**Marco:** Right, so, many students would probably say "His computer was acting strangely". 

**Erica:** "His computer isn't working properly". 

**Marco:** Exactly, and that's perfect and that's fine. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but there's a really great way to say it that we heard in the dialogue. 

> Phrase 1: It's acting up again. It's acting up again. 

**Erica:** I love this phrase it's acting up. Yeah… 

**Marco:** It just… 

**Erica:** It sounds really natural. 

**Marco:** It sounds really natural. Okay, we're ready to listen to our dialogue a third time, but this time… 

**Erica:** It'll be at the normal speed. Try and see if you can hear these keywords. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Erica:** So, Marco, I really think that my computer actually has a virus now. 

**Marco:** Really? How come? 

**Erica:** Because I have been turning on my computer and then suddenly it turns off by itself. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** It shuts down by itself. 

**Marco:** Yeah, that sounds like a virus. 

**Erica:** But I ran a virus scan and there was no problem. 

**Marco:** Hm, well, maybe your antivirus software isn't up to date. 

**Erica:** Yeah, I guess I'd better call Samuel. 

**Marco:** Yeah! Yeah, you can call Samuel to fix it. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, folks, we're out of time now, but be sure to go to our website at englishpod.com where you can leave all your questions and comments. 

**Erica:** So, stay tuned for our next great lesson and until next time… Good bye! 

**Marco:** Bye!
