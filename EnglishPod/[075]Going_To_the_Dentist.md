## Going To the Dentist

---

**Marco:** Hello everyone! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're gonna be going to one of the least favorite places of many, many people. 

**Erica:** So, it must be the dentist. 

**Marco:** Exactly, that place where you have to go every six months, but you… 

**Erica:** You probably don't go… 

**Marco:** Hehe. You probably don't. I know, I don't go… 

**Erica:** No… 

**Marco:** Every six months. 

**Erica:** Me neither. 

**Marco:** So, yeah, we're gonna be going to the dentist and, of course, we're gonna be looking at a lot of great vocabulary, related to teeth and all that crazy stuff dentists do. 

**Erica:** Yes, and we'll also learn some really interesting phrases, um, so, Marco, let's get started with our "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Marco:** Okay, in vocabulary preview today we have two words. Let's take a look at the first one 

– toothache. 

**Erica:** Toothache. 

**Marco:** Toothache. 

**Erica:** Toothache. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, we've seen before this, uh… this ending "-ache", right? 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** It means that hurts. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** So, again, a toothache would be… 

**Erica:** A hurting tooth. 

**Marco:** A hurting tooth. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** We can also say stomachache… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Headache. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Pretty much everything can… [NOTE: pretty much = almost, basically, in most cases, most of the time, etc.] 

**Erica:** Ache. 

**Marco:** Ache. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, our next word – x-ray. 

**Marco:** X-ray. 

**Erica:** X-ray. X, hyphen ("-"), R, A, Y. 

**Marco:** Okay, pretty easy word. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, when you go to the doctor, many times you'll get an x-ray. 

**Erica:** It is a picture of your bones. 

**Marco:** Right, so, that's an x-ray. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue. So, why don't we listen as Gary visits his dentist? 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, that always happens the dentist says "no, it's not gonna hurt, don't worry about it"… 

**Erica:** But it always hurts much more than he says. 

**Marco:** Exactly. So, in this dialogue we saw some interesting words, when the dentist was describing what problems Gary had. 

**Erica:** Yes. So, why don't we look at those now in "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Alright, let's take a look at our first word. 

**Erica:** So, Gary said that his face was all swollen. 

**Marco:** Swollen. 

**Erica:** Swollen. 

**Marco:** Swollen. 

**Erica:** So, swollen is an adjective, right Marco? 

**Marco:** Right, so, his face is or was swollen. 

**Erica:** It was bigger. 

**Marco:** Yeah, his face was bigger than normal. 

**Erica:** Yes, often when you hurt yourself, that part of your body becomes swollen. 

**Marco:** Swollen, right. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, you have to put some ice on it usually and then the swelling will go down. 

**Erica:** And that's the noun, the swelling. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** The swelling. And, well, the verb, to swell. 

**Erica:** Alright, three words for the price of one. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to some examples of how we would use the swelling, swollen, and to swell. 

**Example One** 

> A: My nose is swollen; it's the size of a foot ball. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Put some ice on your foot and the swelling will go down. 

**Example Three** 

> C: I got bitten by a spider and my hand is swelling up. 

**Erica:** Aright, so… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Gary's face was swollen and he thought that it was his wisdom teeth. 

**Marco:** Wisdom teeth. 

**Erica:** Wisdom teeth. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, this is interesting, wisdom is like wise. 

**Erica:** Yeah, knowledge. 

**Marco:** Knowledge. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, these teeth, they're not knowledgeable, but they're called wisdom teeth. 

**Erica:** They are the teeth that grow last in your mouth, right? 

**Marco:** Right, they are the last teeth at the very end of your mouth. 

**Erica:** Yes, and usually you get them when you are about twenty. 

**Marco:** Uhu. And since they come out at this age, sometimes they interfere… they, uh, hurt a little bit, so you have to get them taken out. [NOTE: (1) interfere in this context means to intersect or to impede, for example, these two teeth interfere, they impede each other; (2) to get a tooth taken out means to remove a tooth; you might also say to get a tooth pulled, for example, I got my wisdom teeth pulled this morning] 

**Erica:** Yes, alright, wisdom teeth. 

**Marco:** Wisdom teeth, okay. Now, for our next word and something that we all got as children. Cavity. 

**Erica:** Cavity. 

**Marco:** A cavity. 

**Erica:** A cavity. It's a hole in your tooth. 

**Marco:** A hole in your tooth. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And it's caused by… 

**Erica:** Too much sugar. 

**Marco:** Too much sugar, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or not brushing your teeth enough. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, that's why everyone had it, I think, as children cavities. 

**Erica:** I never had a cavity. 

**Marco:** Really? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Wow, didn't have much sugar? 

**Erica:** I guess I was a bit of a health nut when I was a kid [NOTE: a health nut basically refers to a person who obsessed with their health and, particularly, with healthy nutrition] 

**Marco:** Uh, okay. 

**Erica:** Well, no, I wasn't, my mom was. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** No, I guess not. Alright, but enough about my eating habits, let's talk about our next word, crown. 

**Marco:** Crown. 

**Erica:** A crown. 

**Marco:** So, a crown, this is interesting. 

**Erica:** We're not taking kings and queens. 

**Marco:** Right, that's the first thing that comes to mind, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** No, a crown is actually the visible part of your teeth. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, there's one part of your tooth that's inside that you can't see, right? 

**Marco:** Right, that's called the root. 

**Erica:** Yes, so, when he said "your crown is loose", what's he talking really about the actual tooth? 

**Marco:** So, sometimes people will have… will lose a tooth or have a really bad cavity. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, the dentist needs to make a new crown or a new visible part of the tooth for you, so, sometimes it'll be made of gold… 

**Erica:** Yep, or… 

**Marco:** You know… 

**Erica:** Or porcelain. [NOTE: porcelain is a hard ceramic material; for example, porcelain dishes] 

**Marco:** Porcelain. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** So, a crown, it's like, ah, a really, really, really big filling. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** A crown, so his crown needed to be refitted or put back into place. 

**Erica:** Yes, now our final word, a filling. [NOTE: don't confuse this word with another one, which sounds similarly - feeling] 

**Marco:** Filling. 

**Erica:** A filling. 

**Marco:** A filling. 

**Erica:** So, I just said this word previously. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Now, when you have a cavity… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** You need to fill it in. 

**Marco:** Right, you need to fill it with something. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** It's usually some sort of paste. 

**Erica:** Aha. And it gets really hard… 

**Marco:** And it gets… 

**Erica:** Just like your tooth. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, then it covers up this cavity. Filling. 

**Erica:** A filling. 

**Marco:** I have many fillings, I wasn't, uh, very healthy as a kid. 

**Erica:** Alright, not a good tooth brusher. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Exactly. So, why don't we listen to this dialogue again and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about some of the interesting phrases, that the doctor used. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Well, the dentist used three really interesting phrases and I wanna look at the first one. What seems to be the problem? 

**Marco:** What seems to be the problem? 

**Erica:** What seems to be the problem? 

**Marco:** Okay, very easy, little sentence to ask somebody "what's wrong". 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Um, and… I mean these are small easy words, but when you put them together they sound really natural, um, and… and really fluent. 

**Marco:** Uhu. So, if you ask somebody what seems to be the problem, it's very polite… 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** And it's a very good way of asking "what's wrong". 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** Our next phrase also made up of simple words. Let's have a look. 

**Marco:** Let's have a look. 

**Erica:** Let's have a look. 

**Marco:** So, this is a phrase, that maybe your mechanic of your dentist or your doctor will say. 

**Erica:** Or anyone. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Your… 

**Marco:** Let's have a look 

**Erica:** Let's look at it and see what the problem is. 

**Marco:** Hm, okay, let's have a look. 

**Erica:** Okay, and our final phrase. It doesn't look good. 

**Marco:** It doesn't look good. 

**Erica:** It doesn't look good. 

**Marco:** So, I can use this phrase for an object, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Like, uh, this house doesn't look good. 

**Erica:** Yes, but here it's used a little bit differently. So, why don't we listen to some examples to help us understand the meaning? 

**Example One** 

> A: John told me it doesn't look good for me, I probably won't get the job. 

**Example Two** 

> B: It doesn't look good for Michael Jackson. He's in a lot of debt. 

**Example Three** 

> C: You know, the economy doesn't look very good. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, in the examples we can see, that they are using it for the situation. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** It looks maybe problematic. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it'll… so, when you say it doesn't look good, you basically mean… there are going to be problems. 

**Marco:** Uhu. Alright, it doesn't look good. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, great phrases, great words, let's listen to our, uh, "Gary at the dentist" one more time, then we'll come back and talk a little bit more. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Erica:** Well, Marco, um, speaking of dentists, have you ever had an experience like this, where you've spat out the tooth at the dentist? 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, nothing so, uh, serious as this, but, actually, recently when I was in Cambodia… 

**Erica:** Alright, you called us from Cambodia. 

**Marco:** Yeah, Hehe. Well, our taxi driver offered us to have some local food… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And he said "well, we're gonna have dog", so that was… 

**Erica:** Oh, dear… 

**Marco:** Interesting, uh, actually it wasn't that bad, it was pretty good, but, you know, if you get around the fact that it's a dog… 

**Erica:** So, what does this have to do with your teeth? 

**Marco:** I was eating it and I bit a bone… 

**Erica:** Oh. 

**Marco:** That was hidden… 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** And I chipped my tooth. 

**Erica:** So, you broke part of your tooth. 

**Marco:** Yeah, like half of it… which I… I had already chipped before, so I had to go to the dentist and so the dentist created a new crown with… not with gold or porcelain, actually with a paste. 

**Erica:** Ouh. 

**Marco:** Aha, and then it becomes hard and it just looks normal. It doesn't even look like I have a… a fake crown, sort of say. 

**Erica:** But, dentists can be really expensive, so how much did this cost? 

**Marco:** W… Hehe. Well, this was for the bargain price of ten dollars. [NOTE: for a bargain price means for a relatively small amount of money] 

**Erica:** Ten dollars. 

**Marco:** Ten dollars… 

**Erica:** Nice. 

**Marco:** That's how much it costs. 

**Erica:** So, we should all go to Cambodia for dentistry. 

**Marco:** For… yeah, because actually he was pretty good. He looked very young, though, I was kind of scared, because when he walked in he looked like he was nineteen, but I asked him his age and he was like thirty. 

**Erica:** Okay, well, you're very trusting. [NOTE: trusting is an adjective and it refers to a person who believes other people easily] 

**Marco:** Hehe. Yeah, so, I imagine that you guys maybe have some dental experiences. So, why don't you come to our website and tell us all about it. 

**Erica:** Yeah, visit us at englishpod.com and you can find lots more resources, uh, for learning English there. Well, guys thanks for listening and until next time… Bye! 

**Marco:** Good bye!
