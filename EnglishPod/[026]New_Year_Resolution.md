---

**Marco:** Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod! Happy New Year! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** Happy New Year! 

**Erica:** Happy New Year, Marco! 

**Marco:** It's December thirty-first and we are on New Year's Eve. 

**Erica:** That's right and since it's New Year's Eve, we're talking about New Year's resolutions. 

**Marco:** Right, in many places it's very common to make a promise for the New Year. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Something that you will change. 

**Erica:** A promise to yourself. 

**Marco:** To yourself. 

**Erica:** To change something. 

**Marco:** And that's what our dialogue is about today, so, why don't we take a look at our "vocabulary preview" for this lesson? 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Marco:** Okay, on vocabulary preview today we only have one word. 

**Erica:** Eating habits. 

**Marco:** Eating habits. 

**Erica:** Eating habits. 

**Marco:** So, what are eating habits? 

**Erica:** The regular way you eat. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** So, if you eat healthy or if you eat lots of unhealthy food. 

**Marco:** Or even maybe what time you eat, right? If you eat everyday at certain time. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Eating habits. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, we're ready to listen to our dialogue today and it's gonna be a little bit fast, but don't worry about it. 

**Erica:** We'll come back and explain all of the key vocabulary after. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

> A: So, did I tell you about my New Year's resolution? I've decided to go on a diet.

> B: And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

> A: Exactly! I'm going to cut out all that junk I eat; no more chips, no more soda, no more fried food.

> B: I've heard this one before.

> A: But this time I'm going to stick to it. I really mean it! Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time!

> B: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

> A: Thanks, honey, that was a great meal. I'm stuffed. Do we have any chips left?

**Erica:** So, Marco, do you think this guy will be successful in changing his eating habits? 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, I guess he'll never change, but this gives us a great opportunity to look at some great vocabulary in this lesson in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Our first word on language takeaway is junk. 

**Erica:** Junk. 

**Marco:** Junk. 

**Erica:** Junk. 

**Marco:** So, junk comes from junk food. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Unhealthy food. 

**Erica:** Yeah, fries, chips. 

**Marco:** Hamburgers. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** All that junk. 

**Erica:** All that junk. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, our second word for language takeaway – transform.

**Marco:** He's going to change his eating habits. 

**Erica:** Yeah, our third word is… 

**Marco:** Stuffed. 

**Erica:** Stuffed. 

**Marco:** Stuffed. 

**Erica:** I'm stuffed. 

**Marco:** So, we have some great examples on how we can use staffed and you'll get the meaning from it. 

**Example One** 

> A: Come on! Have one more piece of cake. 

> B: Oh, I can't. I'm stuffed. 

**Example Two** 

> C: Oh, I ate way too much! I'm stuffed! 

**Marco:** Okay, I'm stuffed. 

**Erica:** The feeling you get if you eat too much food. 

**Marco:** Right, I'm full. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, these are some great words that you can use talking about food… 

**Erica:** And eating habits. 

**Marco:** And eating habits. Ah, and now we can listen to our dialogue a second time and this time like always it's gonna be slow.

**Marco:** So, stick to it, right? 

**Erica:** Basically means keep doing it. 

**Marco:** Right. Even though English learning can be hard… 

**Erica:** You should stick to it. 

**Marco:** Stick to it. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Exactly. Okay, let's look at our second phrase for fluency builder – I mean it.

**Example Two**

**Marco:** Okay, so, cut out means… 

**Erica:** To remove. 

**Marco:** Completely remove. 

**Erica:** Take it away. 

**Marco:** Take it away. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, some great language, some great phrases in our dialogue today. So, why don't we listen to it a third time? And we'll come back in a little bit. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

> A: So, did I tell you about my New Year's resolution? I've decided to go on a diet.

> B: And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

> A: Exactly! I'm going to cut out all that junk I eat; no more chips, no more soda, no more fried food.

> B: I've heard this one before.

> A: But this time I'm going to stick to it. I really mean it! Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time!

> B: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

> A: Thanks, honey, that was a great meal. I'm stuffed. Do we have any chips left?

**Marco:** Okay, so, New Year's resolutions are really common and popular thing in North America. 

**Erica:** It's tradition to make a promise to yourself on New Year's and stick to it throughout the whole year. 

**Marco:** Right, but the funny thing is that very few people actually stick to their New Year's resolution. 

**Erica:** That's true. 

**Marco:** The most common ones are I'm gonna quit smoking. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** That never happens. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** I'm gonna go on a diet. 

**Erica:** Like this guy. 

**Marco:** Hehe. I'm gonna quit drinking. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** That almost never happens either. On New Year's Eve you're still drinking. 

**Erica:** I mean it's… it's a bad time, oh, come on! 

**Marco:** Hehe. And another really common one is I'm going to join a gym. 

**Erica:** That's why gym membership sales are so high in January. 

**Marco:** Right, everyone joins a gym in January, but by… 

**Erica:** Come February… 

**Marco:** Yeah, and very few people in a gym. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, Marco, do you have a New Year's rev… resolution for this year? 

**Marco:** Yes, I have a New Year's resolution and I resolve to continue bringing everyone some great lessons. 

**Erica:** Oh, that's… that's so good. 

**Marco:** And I think I can stick to that one. 

**Erica:** Yes, well, I… I do hope that you do stick to that one, Marco. 

**Marco:** We will, we will, but today we're out of time. So, please go to our website and leave all your questions and comments… 

**Erica:** At englishpod.com. 

**Marco:** And, uh, we'll see you there, but until then it's… 

**Erica:** Good bye! 

**Marco:** Bye!
