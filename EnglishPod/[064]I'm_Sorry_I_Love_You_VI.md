## I'm Sorry, I Love You VI

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you again the great series I'm sorry I love you, Part Six. 

**Erica:** The newest installment in the EnglishPod soap opera. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Drama, romance… 

**Erica:** Love, tragedy. 

**Marco:** Hehe. All of it here at EnglishPod and… and in our series. So, today we have a really great dialogue. 

**Erica:** I… I… I just can't believe what's happening here. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** But before we get into it, we need to preview one word. 

**Marco:** That's right, so let's take a look at it in "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Well, we're gonna preview this word, sleeping with. 

**Marco:** Sleeping with. 

**Erica:** Sleeping with someone. 

**Marco:** Sleeping with him. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So, it seems pretty easy, I mean sleeping with, that just sounds like you are in bed with somebody. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but you are doing a little bit more… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Than sleeping. 

**Marco:** Alright, so… so in English this phrase actually means that you are involved with someone and have an intimate sexual relationship, right? 

**Erica:** Yes, you are in a relationship with someone and you are having sex. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so be careful how you use it, because I know that sometimes you wanna translate and just say, well, they're in the same bed together, but it's not that they're having sex. 

**Erica:** Right, so most of the time in English the phrase sleeping with means sex. 

**Marco:** Right, okay, sleeping with, be careful. 

**Erica:** Okay, well, let's find out why are we talking about sleeping with? 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, obviously, somebody is sleeping with somebody, so let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and talk about [it]. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Scandal, again. 

**Erica:** Oh, these… poor Veronica and Steven, I just… I don't know how their relationship could get more complicated. 

**Marco:** It's amazing they're having an amazing, ah, adventure in their love life. 

**Erica:** I'm sure glad my love life looks nothing like this. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, so, we saw some really great words, so let's take a look at them in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** The words we're looking at now are about feelings. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And, so let's take a look at the first one, confess. 

**Marco:** Okay, confess. 

**Erica:** To confess. 

**Marco:** To confess. So, confess, what does that mean? 

**Erica:** When you confess something, you… you tell a secret that you've been hiding. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that's pretty easy. So, you have a secret and you wanna tell it to someone, so you are confessing. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and it's usually something negative. 

**Marco:** Negative… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Oh, Okay. 

**Erica:** So, Marco, I confess that I stole five dollars from you. 

**Marco:** Oh, you did? 

**Erica:** Yeah, sorry. 

**Marco:** Ah, okay… no wonder my wallet was lighter. 

**Erica:** Hehe. Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, confess. 

**Erica:** Uh. 

**Marco:** I shall not forgive you for this. 

**Erica:** Hehe. Oh, no. 

**Marco:** Alright, let's take a look at our next word, overwhelmed. 

**Erica:** Overwhelmed. 

**Marco:** I'm overwhelmed. 

**Erica:** So, when I am overwhelmed, I am filled with emotion. 

**Marco:** Okay, with emotion. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** It can be good emotions and bad emotions, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, but you just… you feel too much. That's like you're… you're… you're going to explode. 

**Marco:** Okay, I'm overwhelmed with joy. 

**Erica:** Yes, or I'm overwhelmed with work. 

**Marco:** And I'm overwhelmed with jealousy. 

**Erica:** Like this guy. 

**Marco:** Right, and that's our third word. 

**Erica:** Jealousy. 

**Marco:** Jealousy. So, this is interesting because jealousy is the noun. 

**Erica:** That's right, it's the feeling… 

**Marco:** Of being jealous. 

**Erica:** Wh… which is the adjective. 

**Marco:** Which is the adjective. So, what does it mean when you are jealous? 

**Erica:** It means that you… you see somebody and you want what they have. 

**Marco:** Okay, you want what they have. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so in this case the doctor is jealous of Veronica's boyfriend, sh… because the doctor wants Veronica. 

**Marco:** Okay, jealous. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So… so, Erica, are you a… are you a jealous wife? 

**Erica:** Um, I don't know, maybe a little bit. 

**Marco:** A little bit. 

**Erica:** But I've never gone to the extent of telling someone that they're pregnant, when they're not. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, jealousy. Okay, and let's take a look at our next two words which are actually kind of insult, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, they're not very kind words at all. 

**Marco:** Okay, but you gotta learn them anyways. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's take a look at this one, jerk. 

**Erica:** Jerk. 

**Marco:** He is a jerk. 

**Erica:** J-E-R-K, jerk. 

**Marco:** Jerk. So, what does it mean if someone is a jerk? 

**Erica:** A stupid and mean person. 

**Marco:** Hehe. As plain and simple as that. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Stupid and mean. So, can a woman be a jerk? 

**Erica:** It's mostly male, but now it's becoming more common to… to use with women as well. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I can say he is a jerk or she is a jerk. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but it is more common for men. 

**Marco:** Okay, and now let's take a look at our last word, you lying bastard! 

**Erica:** Bastard. 

**Marco:** Bastard. 

**Erica:** Bastard. 

**Marco:** Wow, this is pretty strong as well. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you gotta be careful about this one. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** This one is almost a swearword. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Almost. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** It sounds like on the line. [NOTE: meaning on the line between being a swearword and not being a swearword] 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, what does it mean if you call someone a bastard. 

**Erica:** Well, literally it means your mother and father were not married when you… when you were born. 

**Marco:** When you were born. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Exactly. So, it is a pretty big insult. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** A little bit, I guess… 

**Erica:** But… but it doesn't really really mean that your mother and father… 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Weren't married. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** It just… 

**Marco:** But you're… 

**Erica:** It means that you are a jerk. 

**Marco:** You're a jerk, you're really… 

**Erica:** You're mean. 

**Marco:** Big jerk. 

**Erica:** You're mean person, a really mean person. 

**Marco:** So, jerk isn't as strong as a bastard. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Bastard is stronger. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you gotta be careful when you throw that word in there or how you would use it and again it's for men, right? Not for women. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you can't use this word with women. 

**Marco:** Okay, that's… 

**Erica:** There's another one out there, but that will have to wait for another EnglishPod. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, apparently all of these words are just for men, what did we do wrong? 

**Erica:** I… Marco, I can't begin to tell you. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay. Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and look at some great phrases. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Alright, so, great stuff, jerk, bastard, all that good words going around. 

**Erica:** But we've got… also got some amazing phrases, so why don't we take a look at those now in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** Alright, so in fluency builder today we have three great phrases, let's take a look at the first one. Bun in the oven. 

**Erica:** A bun in the oven. 

**Marco:** A bun in the oven. 

**Erica:** Okay, this is obviously an idiomatic phrase, right? 

**Marco:** Right. Well, it could be literal as well, right? 

**Erica:** Like you could actually have a piece of bread in your oven. 

**Marco:** Right, bun is a piece of bread. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** In the oven, but in this context we're not using it. 

**Erica:** No, um, it means you're pregnant. 

**Marco:** You're pregnant, so the baby is the bun. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and the oven is your stomach. 

**Marco:** Right, so, you say "She has a bun in the oven". 

**Erica:** Yes, she's pregnant. 

**Marco:** She's pregnant, okay. It could be difficult to understand if you don't really, ah, have the explanation, right? 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** You wouldn't… you would say "What? She has bread in the oven?" 

**Erica:** What? Yeah, a bun in the oven. 

**Marco:** Okay, now let's take a look at our second one. Couldn't help myself. [NOTE: another one - can't help but; for example, we can find this phrase in President Obama's Inauguration Speech: "we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass"] 

**Erica:** I couldn't help myself. 

**Marco:** I couldn't help myself. 

**Erica:** So, when you can't help yourself, you can't control yourself. 

**Marco:** Right, you… you did something, be… but you couldn't control it. 

**Erica:** You couldn't stop it. 

**Marco:** You couldn't stop it. Okay, so let's listen to some examples of how you would use I couldn't help myself, because i… it's a phrase that you can use in many different ways, right? 

**Erica:** That's right, let's listen. 

**Example One** 

> A: I just couldn't help myself when I saw your car I just had to buy it! 

**Example Two** 

> B: I'm sorry I couldn't help myself, I just started laughing. 

**Example Three** 

> C: The cake was so good I couldn't help myself I ate it all. 

**Marco:** Alright, perfect, couldn't help myself, easy. 

**Erica:** Now, the doctor, he couldn't help himself from lying to Veronica. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Because he was angry that her boyfriend Steven came into the picture. 

**Marco:** Came into the picture. 

**Erica:** To come into the picture. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, what does it mean when somebody comes into the picture? 

**Erica:** Well, basically, you appear in somebody's life, you come into somebody's life. 

**Marco:** So imagine that, your life is a picture… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** And somebody all of a sudden comes into it, so… 

**Erica:** They come into the picture. 

**Marco:** Come in… 

**Erica:** They come into your life. 

**Marco:** Come into your life. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So, he's angry that Steven appeared into Veronica's life and they're in love and all that stuff, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, alright, well, these are some great phases and why don't we listen to them again in context, so let's listen to the dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, Veronica's not pregnant, that was a close one. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Phewh, hoo. 

**Marco:** A… actually they're not married, so this is a very controversial topic, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Being knocked up. 

**Erica:** Yes, nice phrase. 

**Marco:** Nice phrase. 

**Erica:** So… there's a lot of interesting phrases and, um, an… and ways you can talk about pregnancy, so if you're knocked up, you are pregnant. 

**Marco:** Right, so, you could hear that in movies. It's not really… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I would say, a proper way of saying. 

**Erica:** No, it's not that polite. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Because it… it… it gives you the idea that it was a mistake. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Uh. 

**Marco:** So, you would say she got knocked up. 

**Erica:** Yes, another common phrase is, um, pregers. 

**Marco:** Pregers. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I heard this is, ah, more Australian, right? 

**Erica:** Uh, she's pregrous, so she's pregnant. 

**Marco:** Aha. So, it's actually a pretty interesting topic, I know that, for example, in Latin America if a girl that's maybe in her early twenties… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Gets pregnant accidentally by her boyfriend… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Usually the family is expected them to get married. 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** Yeah, so, it's kind of like should they get married, should they not… 

**Erica:** So, there's a lot of pressure. 

**Marco:** A lot of pressure, but it's different in other countries, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. So, I d… I don't know for you guys, wha… what's it like in… in your country, where… where you live. Is there pressure on the… the guy and the girl to get married? I mean should Steven and Veronica get married in this situation? 

**Marco:** Or what about just living together? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or as they say living in sin, right? [NOTE: Living in sin = Living together without official marriage] 

**Erica:** Living in sin. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Living together, living in sin. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** So, is it okay to just live together with your… girlfriend or should you get married before? 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** This is the controversial topic, so we'll have a lot of different opinions, but it should be interesting. 

**Erica:** Yes, so visit our website and tell us what you think, englishpod.com. 

**Marco:** Alright guys, we'll see you there.
