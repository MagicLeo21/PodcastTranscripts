## That's Funny!

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're gonna have a fun… funny lesson. 

**Erica:** That's right. So, I think this lesson's gonna be a little bit different than most of our lessons, right? 

**Marco:** Right, today we're gonna be looking at jokes, which is a very important part of English speaking culture. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, we're actually… we're gonna teach you a few, um, prettyhilarious jokes. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** But we're also gonna teach you some language related to jokes, funny things and, um, that sort of stuff. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, in order for us to understand a little bit better the jokes that we're gonna be looking at, why don't we take a look at "vocabulary preview"? 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Two of these words you'll hear in the dialogue, but one you won't, but you still need to know this word, so you can understand the jokes. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, the word that we're talking about is not really a word, it's a sound. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Moo. 

**Erica:** Moo. 

**Marco:** So, moo is the sound that cows make. 

**Erica:** That's right, M-O-O. 

**Marco:** Right, they go "moooo". 

**Erica:** Very nice, Marco. 

**Marco:** Uh, I could do a good cow. 

**Erica:** Yep. Alright, so, we all know now that that's what cows say. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, it's gonna be important for the joke and you'll see why. 

**Erica:** Okay, now, another word that you need to understand is a dam. 

**Marco:** So, a dam. 

**Erica:** A dam. 

**Marco:** A dam is, uh, is… is like a big wall, right? 

**Erica:** Well, it's a wall in water that stops the river from flowing. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, usually they'll build dams in rivers and then the water can pass or not. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's something that you use to generate electricity, right? 

**Marco:** Very good, but there's another word that sounds exactly the same way, but it's just spelled a little differently. 

**Erica:** That's right and… and we might hear someone say "Oh, damn!" 

**Marco:** And that's an interjection which basically means… 

**Erica:** "Oh, no!" 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** "That's terrible!" 

**Marco:** Aha. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Damn… I can say "Damn, I forgot my keys". 

**Erica:** Uhu. "Damn, we're late for the movie". 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it's an interesting interjection and we'll also see it in one of our jokes. And now, let's move on to our last word. 

**Erica:** Nostrils. 

**Marco:** Okay, nostrils. 

**Erica:** Nostrils. 

**Marco:** So, a nostril or your nostrils… 

**Erica:** Are the two holes in your nose. 

**Marco:** Right, you breathe through your nostrils. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, now that we've taken a look at these three words, why don't we listen to our comedian for the first time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Erica:** Okay, so, some pretty hilarious jokes, huh? 

**Marco:** I don't think the crowd really enjoyed them all that much. 

**Erica:** Okay, well, maybe, um, I'm just a fan of really terrible jokes. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, they were pretty funny, but I guess the crowd just didn't appreciate his, uh, sense of humor. 

**Erica:** But you know what, they did use quite a lot of really interesting language, so why don't we look at that now in "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** On language takeaway we're gonna be looking at six words today, so let's get started. The announcer welcomed everyone and said that, uh, it's open mic night. 

**Erica:** Open mic night. 

**Marco:** So, an open mic night. 

**Erica:** Okay, well, we know mic is short for microphone, right? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Now, an open mic night is a chance for anyone can come up and talk into the microphone. 

**Marco:** So, you can come up and sing or you can tell jokes, you can do anything, basically. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Alright, open mic night. 

**Erica:** So, it's not for professionals, but for people who maybe want to be professionals. 

**Marco:** Right, amateurs. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, it was open mic night and he said they had a lot of greatcomics there. 

**Erica:** So, comics. 

**Marco:** A comic. 

**Erica:** A comic. 

**Marco:** So, basically, a comic is a person… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** That makes a living by making people laugh. 

**Erica:** Yeah, someone who… who stands up on stage and tells jokes. 

**Marco:** Alright, would you say a clown is kind of like a comic? 

**Erica:** No, they're different. 

**Marco:** They're different, right? 

**Erica:** A… a comic doesn't wear a red nose and a crazy… 

**Marco:** A costume. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, yeah, cause I hate clowns! Hehe. 

**Erica:** We do know that about you. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, a comic. And, well, what comics do is they performstand-up comedy. 

**Erica:** Stand-up comedy. 

**Marco:** Stand-up comedy. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, stand-up comedy is… is really exactly what its name suggests, right? 

**Marco:** Right, you stand up in front of, uh… an audience and you tell jokes and… or you make them laugh. 

**Erica:** Yeah, tell funny stories. 

**Marco:** It's a very popular form of entertainment in the United States and the UK. 

**Erica:** That's right, um, and I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the end of the lesson. But why don't we move on to our next word which is routine. 

**Marco:** A routine. 

**Erica:** So, the guy says "I've been working on my routine". 

**Marco:** So, what does he mean by his routine? 

**Erica:** Well, I guess a… a routine is like a series or a collection of jokes or maybe movements that you use in a performance. 

**Marco:** Alright, a routine. 

**Erica:** So, you can talk about a dance routine. 

**Marco:** Or in this case a comedy routine. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, the series of jokes he's gonna tell. 

**Erica:** That's right, that he practices again and again and again. 

**Marco:** Alright, and in his routine he said he's got a lot of zingers. 

**Erica:** Zingers. 

**Marco:** A zinger. 

**Erica:** So, what's a zinger? 

**Marco:** Basically, a zinger is like a strong, maybe a little bit rude joke. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but like, uh, kind of a one line joke, right? 

**Marco:** Right, exactly. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And the people that were in the crowd and they were booing him, they were like "Boo". 

**Erica:** Mm. 

**Marco:** Those we call hecklers. 

**Erica:** Exactly and that's our last word – a heckler. 

**Marco:** A heckler. 

**Erica:** Hecklers. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to some hecklers in action. The sound of booing hecklers. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, I think that's pretty clear. Those are definitely hecklers. 

**Marco:** Right, they're very annoying. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, now that we finished looking at all the words that are related to comedy and performances, let's, uh, take a look at the jokes now in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** Okay, well, we're not really focusing on… on new phrases for you here, but we thought it would be helpful to, um, talk a little bit about the jokes to help you understand them, right? Cause they are, well, I think pretty funny. 

**Marco:** Yeah, they're pretty funny, but maybe sometimes they're kind of hard to understand. So, why don't we start with the first joke? So, he said where do you find a one-legged dog? 

**Erica:** What's a… a one-legged dog? 

**Marco:** Basically, it's a dog that has one leg. 

**Erica:** Uh, okay, and the pronunciation here's… is important, right? 

**Marco:** One-leggEd. 

**Erica:** Not, one-leggeD. 

**Marco:** No. 

**Erica:** One-leggEd. 

**Marco:** So, you can say "A one-legged dog, a two-legged dog or a three-legged dog". 

**Erica:** Six-legged dog? 

**Marco:** A six-legged spider, maybe lost two legs in, you know… in a war. 

**Erica:** Oh, dear. Okay, so, uh, the dog obviously didn't go anywhere and so that's why you find it where you left it. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, that's why it's kind of funny. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, then he said what do you call a sheep with no legs? 

**Erica:** I don't know. 

**Marco:** A cloud. Basically, because, you know, sheep are fluffy add they're white, so if you take away their legs, they look like a little cloud. 

**Erica:** Boo. 

**Marco:** Alright, let's look at the next one. He asked what do cows do for entertainment? 

**Erica:** And then the answer was they rent mooovies. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, it's kind of funny, because he's relating this wordmovies with what the… with the sound that cows make, which ismoo. 

**Erica:** Right, and actually, um, there are a million jokes in English following the same pattern, right? 

**Marco:** Yeah, exactly. So, I'm sure you can find a lot more of them and you can share them with us. 

**Erica:** Now, my personal favorite joke is the guy says what does a fish say when it runs into a wall? 

**Marco:** So, to run into a wall, basically, is to crash against the wall. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, what does a fish say? 

**Erica:** Dam! 

**Marco:** So, why is this funny? Why does he say "Dam"? 

**Erica:** Well, cause it's… I mean if you… if you… if you a person and you run into a wall… Damn! Like the… you know, just like "Oh, no!" 

**Marco:** Ouch… ouch. 

**Erica:** Ou… yeah. But a fish is swimming under the water and like we saw a dam is actually like a wall in the water. 

**Marco:** So, he's saying like "Oh, a wall". 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, it's that… I like that one. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, the last one was pretty good. Why do gorillas have big nostrils? 

**Erica:** Okay, so, the big holes in their nose. 

**Marco:** Right, and basically it's because they have big fingers. 

**Erica:** So, they can put their fingers in the nose? 

**Marco:** Yeah, exactly! How… 

**Erica:** Oh, dear. 

**Marco:** If the gorilla didn't have big nostrils, he wouldn't be able to pick his nose. 

**Erica:** Maybe he'd have to use a stick. 

**Marco:** Yeah, but that wouldn't be convenient, see? 

**Erica:** Alright. 

**Marco:** So, that's why those jokes are funny. They're very short jokes. Some… of course, some of them are not actually really funny, but, uh… it's just a little bit of a taste of short American jokes. 

**Erica:** Okay, well, I think we need to hear them one more time in context, so, um, you can all know how funny or maybe not so funny they are. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** 

**Erica:** And now, if you have any, uh, good jokes of your own, uh, why don't you come to our website and tell us about them? 

**Marco:** Right, come to englishpod.com, share with us any jokes. Of course, they have to be clean. Don't come and… 

**Erica:** No… yeah, no swears. 

**Marco:** No swearing in the… in the jokes. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, we'll see you guys there and until next time… 

**Erica:** Thanks for listening and… Good bye! 

**Marco:** Bye!
