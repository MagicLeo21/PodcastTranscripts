**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you another lesson on our sports series. 

**Erica:** Uhu. We're talking about baseball today. 

**Marco:** Baseball – the American national pastime. [NOTE: pastime = an activity or entertainment that makes time pass pleasantly] 

**Erica:** Is it? 

**Marco:** Yes, it is. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** So, we're gonna be looking at this interesting sport that is played mainly in the Caribbean and, well, it's actually very popular in the United States and Japan. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** Korea. 

**Erica:** Yeah. So, we're not only gonna learn a bunch of baseball language, but we're also going to see how baseball has a big influence on English in general. [NOTE: a bunch of something 

= a lot of something] 

**Marco:** That's right, so, we're gonna learn a lot of great things today. So, why don't we start and listen to our dialogue? 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Erica:** Alright, well, a pretty exiting game there at Richie Stadium 

**Marco:** Exactly, and we have some interesting players: Roger Vargas and Brian Okami. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, well, we saw some great words and, well, it's time for us to take a look at them now in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Okay, we're gonna look at some, uh, common sports and baseball words here. And the first phrase – we'll hear this almost at any sort of international sports event, right? 

**Marco:** Exactly, and it's the national anthem. 

**Erica:** National anthem. 

**Marco:** National anthem. 

**Erica:** So, this is a song, right? 

**Marco:** Exactly, it's the song that you sing about your country. And many people confuse it, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, a lot of people might say "national hymn". 

**Marco:** Okay, hymn. Because in some languages it might be like a hymn. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Like literally translating. 

**Erica:** Yeah 

**Marco:** But in English it's called the national anthem. 

**Erica:** The national anthem. 

**Marco:** Alright. So, what about our next word? 

**Erica:** Well, we were talking about the pitcher. 

**Marco:** Pitcher. 

**Erica:** P-I-T-C-H-E-R. 

**Marco:** The pitcher. 

**Erica:** Pitcher. 

**Marco:** Okay, and now this is one of the players on a baseball team. And his job is to… 

**Erica:** To throw the ball. 

**Marco:** To throw the ball really fast. 

**Erica:** So that the guy can't hit it with the bat. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that's the pitcher. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Now, the interesting thing is that the baseball commentator said "the pitcher winds up". 

**Erica:** Winds up. 

**Marco:** To wind up 

**Erica:** To wind up. Okay, well, let me paint you a picture. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** So, imagine a clock. 

**Marco:** Aha. 

**Erica:** And you're turning, turning and turning the clock to wind it up, to get it ready to go. 

**Marco:** To make it work. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** So, imagine the pitcher doing the same sort of a thing – bringing his arm back behind them, getting ready to throw the ball. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that is to wind up. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Very good. So, you can use this word not only in baseball, but for other things that require you to do this action. 

**Erica:** Right, to turn something and get it… get it ready to have lots of power. 

**Marco:** Like some toys. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or maybe like a m… a music box. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, wind up. What about our next phrase? 

**Erica:** Well, Roger Vargas hit a line drive. 

**Marco:** Line drive. 

**Erica:** Line drive. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, what is a line drive? 

**Erica:** Well, it's a term from baseball and when you hit a line drive, you hit the ball sort of low… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** On towards the ground and it… it travels along the outside of the field. 

**Marco:** Right, so, the ball basically travels along the foul line. 

**Erica:** Uhu, the white line. 

**Marco:** The white line. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Exactly. Very good, so, that's a line drive. 

**Erica:** And, so, the players on the field were scrambling to get the ball. 

**Marco:** Scrambling. 

**Erica:** Scrambling. 

**Marco:** Now, we know scrambled eggs form one of our lessons. 

**Erica:** Yes, uh, but the verb to scramble means to, um, move quickly in a disorganized way to do something. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, the players are moving very fast, trying to get the ball, but they're not dong it very well. 

**Erica:** Right. And you can use this other ways, right? Not just in baseball. 

**Marco:** Right, for example, we can say "the people are scrambling to buy their tickets for the concert". 

**Erica:** Yeah, or I'm going on vacation tomorrow and I'm scrambling to get everything ready. 

**Marco:** Exactly, it's a very good term that you can use also in your daily life. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Alright. And what about our last word for today on language takeaway? 

**Erica:** Well, they were in the fifth inning of the game. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, inning. 

**Erica:** Inning. 

**Marco:** Inning. 

**Erica:** Alright, this is another baseball term. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And, um, it… it just means the period of play. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, we learned, for example, that in soccer you have two halves. 

**Erica:** Uhu. Or in hockey, you have three periods. 

**Marco:** Alright. And in baseball you have nine innings. 

**Erica:** Okay, great, so, some interesting sports and baseball vocabulary. Now, I think it'll help us to hear this again slower. So, let's listen to the dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Alright, so, as we said, there're a lot of English terms that come form baseball, but we use them in business context or in your daily life, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, why don't we look at those now in "fluency builder"? 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, the first phrase that we have is up to bat. 

**Erica:** Up to bat. 

**Marco:** Up to bat. 

**Erica:** So, literally in this dialogue it means the guy is standing on home plate ready to hit the ball, right? 

**Marco:** Right. He has the bat and he's ready to hit it. 

**Erica:** But what about in other contexts? 

**Marco:** So, for example, you can be at a meeting. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And maybe it's your turn to talk. 

**Erica:** So, you're up to bat. 

**Marco:** So, the b… yeah, exactly. Your boss will say "okay, Erica, you're up to bat". 

**Erica:** Okay, so, it means sort of like it's your tern. 

**Marco:** It's your turn. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Very good. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, that's another term that is used in baseball, but very commonly used in other circumstances. 

**Erica:** So, we also saw, um, in the dialogue that Roger Vargas, um… he hit the ball, but he missed and that was strike one. 

**Marco:** Right. Strike one. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, in baseball you have three strikes. 

**Erica:** Three tries. 

**Marco:** Three tries before you're out. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And, so, now the same thing happens in daily life. 

**Erica:** So, um, if someone says "that was strike one". 

**Marco:** It means you made the first mistake. 

**Erica:** Yes, and if you make two more, you will be fired, for example. 

**Marco:** Maybe. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Aha. Or maybe your parents will say "okay, you… that wasn't nice, strike one". 

**Erica:** And then two more times and you'll have a time out. [NOTE: a time out = sort of a punishment when a child must stop playing for a while] 

**Marco:** Or you'll be grounded. [NOTE: to be grounded = sort of a punishment when a child must stay home for a certain period of time; i.e. they can't go out and hang out with their friends] 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that's also called a strike. And the pitcher threw a curve ball. 

**Erica:** A curve ball. 

**Marco:** Curve ball. 

**Erica:** So, okay, pretty clear. A curve ball is when you throw the ball and it sort of goes on a curve, it doesn't goes straight, right? 

**Marco:** Right, exactly. 

**Erica:** But how can this be used outside of baseball? 

**Marco:** So, you can say "oh, my boss threw me a curve ball today". 

**Erica:** So, he gave you an unexpected problem. 

**Marco:** Aha, or something that was difficult to handle. 

**Erica:** Okay, um, this one is pretty interesting. I'd like to hear a few more examples. 

**Example One** 

> A: My boss threw me a curve ball today, so I have to stay in work late. 

**Example Two** 

> B: It was a huge curve ball when she asked me how many kids I wanted to have. How am I supposed to know? 

**Marco:** Alright, so, that's basically a curve ball. You can say a non-expected problem… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or situation. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** And our last phrase - and, well, probably one that's you already know – home run. 

**Erica:** A home run. 

**Marco:** A home run. 

**Erica:** From baseball we know that that's when you hit the ball really far. 

**Marco:** And you hit it outside of the… of the playing area or outside the park. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** And now if you use it a business context or in your daily life… 

**Erica:** Uhu. It means something similar. Why don't we take a listen to the examples and see if we can figure it our. 

**Example One** 

> A: Great job on that sales presentation. You really hit a home run. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Our sales team hit a home run this month by doubling our revenue. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, basically, a home run is a success. 

**Erica:** A victory. 

**Marco:** A victory. 

**Erica:** Yeah, something a big accomplishment. 

**Marco:** That's right. So, we've seen a lot of these great phrases and as you can see a lot of them from baseball are used in your daily life and there many, many more. 

**Erica:** Okay, well, why don't we hear them again in the baseball context and we listen to the dialogue one more time? 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, an interesting dialogue; a very interesting sport. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And, well, personally I never played this as a child. 

**Erica:** Uh, me neither, really. 

**Marco:** I don't really like it too much, but it is kind of fun to… go to a game and especially in the United States have those hot dogs and all that stuff. 

**Erica:** Okay, yeah. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** Well, a cultural event; a really important piece of American culture. 

**Marco:** Exactly. So, well, we encourage you to come to our website englishpod.com; tell us what you think and also, of course, if you have questions or doubts, be sure to tell us.
