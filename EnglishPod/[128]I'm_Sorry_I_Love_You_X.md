---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. 

**Catherine:** And my name is Catherine and today Marco and I get to share with you the thrilling conclusion to the, well, very popular, I must say… 

**Marco:** Very popular. 

**Catherine:** Series I'm Sorry I Love You. 

**Marco:** That's right, today is the finale, the final episode - Episode Ten. This is where it all ends, so what do you think is gonna happen? 

**Catherine:** If I guess you're just gonna get angry at me, cause I actually know how it ends, but let's just say I hope that it ends well for ourprotagonists. 

**Marco:** There was a lot of controversy around it, because, you know, I wanted to know if people wanted a happy ending, a sad ending, unexpected. I guess everyone wants a happy ending, right? 

**Catherine:** Absolutely, so we're gonna, well, keep our fingers crossed for Steven and Veronica and check out this dialogue one time. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, uh, they got married. 

**Catherine:** Cough-cough. 

**Marco:** Well, you got married. 

**Catherine:** We got married! I got married! 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** Wow, I should have called my mom. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** That's great. 

**Marco:** And not only did you get married, but you got married Bolliwood style with like… 

**Catherine:** Bollywood! 

**Marco:** Music and everything nice, huh? 

**Catherine:** And those weddings are like for days long. 

**Marco:** Hehe. I hope you, uh, enjoyed the… the finale of… of this, uh, story. 

**Catherine:** Absolutely, I was glad to see that it was a happy ending, I have to say. If it'd been a sad ending, I would have been a little bit disappointed… 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** Because, well, Veronica and I… 

**Marco:** Hehe. You get along. 

**Catherine:** We get along. 

**Marco:** Alright, so apart form this happy ending and this happy finale that we had, uh, we did look at a lot of great words and phrases, so why don't we start now with "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Catherine:** So the first couple of phrases we wanna talk about here have to do with maybe catching up and talking about family or… 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** A gossip, because we're talking to… 

**Marco:** A family member. 

**Catherine:** Steven's Indian family. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** Whom he hasn't seen for a long long time. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** And the first thing he's… he's talking to his brother about his brother and his wife, so Gulam and Nisha are expecting, we find out. 

**Marco:** Right, they're expecting. So if Gulam and Nisha are expecting, what does that mean exactly? 

**Catherine:** Mm, they're expecting a letter? 

**Marco:** Expecting a baby, maybe? 

**Catherine:** Aha, yeah, so here we go. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** I'm expecting is a very common English way of say "I'm going to have a baby", "I'm pregnant". 

**Marco:** Alright, so don't get this confused. If somebody says "Oh, well, I'm expecting", you don't have to say "Expecting what?" 

**Catherine:** Exactly, when it's only expecting, when it's not a thing afterwards, I'm expecting means I'm pregnant or she's expecting – she's gonna have a baby. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So they're expecting a baby. Or they're expecting. Well, and they were talking about, well… Steven, he… he was supposed to get married in India and, uh, his brother said a very interesting word, he said well, "These girls are still, uh… this girl is still pining over you." 

**Catherine:** So this Shalini – some girl that Steven used to… to know when he was living in India. She's pining after you. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Well, pine has many different meanings in English. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** But in this sense we're talking about having a crush on or being in love with. 

**Marco:** And also it's a way of saying that you are… that you desire, youyearn for this person very, vey much. 

**Catherine:** But they… you don't have them. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** You want them. 

**Marco:** You want them, so you're pining over this person. Now, can you pine over an object? 

**Catherine:** No. 

**Marco:** No. 

**Catherine:** No. 

**Marco:** Usually it's maybe, uh, related to love or to… and a person, right? 

**Catherine:** Yeah, so she… she stands by the door everyday waiting the letter that doesn't come, she's pining away for her dear love Tomas or whatever. 

**Marco:** And you know what I read recently is that people can get addicted to pining. 

**Catherine:** Really? 

**Marco:** Yeah, after a break up maybe you can pine after a person, not because you miss them or you want to… you kind of grow accustomed to it and you become addicted to this pain, that's kind of pleasurable. 

**Catherine:** Mm, there is a way to… describe, this is called Petrarchan Love. Well, it's this kind of traditional idea in poetry where you have a love that's never consummated, that's never filled… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** You'll never get to be with the person that you love, that you desire. 

**Marco:** Mm. 

**Catherine:** And so it's a way… it's a way of, uh, distinguishing the two different kinds of love: one where you with the person and the other where you always want them, but you can never have them. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, for you… hopefully none of our listeners are piningover anyone or get to experience that, huh? 

**Catherine:** Exactly, but, uh, if you do pine away or if you pine aftersomeone, um, you have to hope that one day you'll get over that person. 

**Marco:** Yeah, you have to get over it and that's what his brother says "Hey, get over it". 

**Catherine:** I don't think she'll ever get over you. 

**Marco:** So what does that mean when you're supposed to get over someone? 

**Catherine:** Okay, this is a good question, because, you know, we're talking here not about actually getting up on top of a fence or a wall. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** We're taking about emotions, so… 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** Getting over someone, so… I have to get over him… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Means that I have to stop feeling so sad about what… what happened, right? Because usually you say this one someone sad or angry. 

**Marco:** And…and also it kind of means that you have to forget or let that person go, you know like… 

**Catherine:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Get over it. 

**Catherine:** We're gonna move on here to the last word in today's language takeaway which is incorrigible. 

**Marco:** Okay, an incorrigible person. 

**Catherine:** Alright, incorrigible. What could this mean? Well, let's look at the sentence where we find it: you are incorrigible. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Gulam says this to Steven. 

**Marco:** Right, so, it's an adjective and basically it means that you have no correction of some sort. 

**Catherine:** Well, there's an argument between Steven and Gulam. So they're brothers and Steven says "I don't wanna get married, I don't wanna married here", ah-ah-ah. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** He's complaining and his brother says "You're incorrigible!" 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** You just won't stop. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** So someone's… someone's feelings, their emotions, their ideas about something, they just can't be changed or… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Or altered, they're fixed. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** You know, this guy, he's like "I'm not gonna get married" and his brother says "Ouh, you're incorrigible". 

**Marco:** Hehe. So… 

**Catherine:** I just can't change your mind. 

**Marco:** It's kind of like being stubborn. 

**Catherine:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Yeah, exactly. And we hear this phrase a lot, um, together, soyou're incorrigible. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** Right, so this is often just kind of, uh… it's a f… it's not an insult, but it's a way for us to kind of be sarcastic or to make fun of someone. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** You're incorrigible, Marco. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright. 

**Catherine:** Usually, it's saying when you're ???, you know, you're being nice or fine. 

**Marco:** Yeah, alright. 

**Catherine:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, cool, so five great words in language takeaway today and, well, before we move on and listen to the dialogue again, why don't we take a look at "fluency builder"? 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Catherine:** Alright, this first phrase is something that parents often use and grandparents as well. 

**Marco:** Mm. 

**Catherine:** Because obviously parents and grandparents, they have proud of their children and grandchildren. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** So they describe something as being their pride and joy. 

**Marco:** Uhu. My pride and joy. So it's, uh, usually a person that's your pride and joy. 

**Catherine:** I could be a thing too. 

**Marco:** It could be a thing. 

**Catherine:** His Porsche Boxter is his pride and joy. He goes out every morning and he washes it… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** He changes the oil, he checks the gas, he checks the tires, so it's his pride and joy. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Catherine:** It's his most valued possession. 

**Marco:** So it always goes together, right? My pride and joy. 

**Catherine:** Pride and joy, yeah. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Just think of it as a phrase – pride and joy. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Catherine:** So, um, I'm my mother's pride and joy. 

**Marco:** I think you are. 

**Catherine:** Mm. Hehe. 

**Marco:** Alright, so… 

**Catherine:** You don't know my mom. 

**Marco:** Well… Alright, so… so somebody's pride and joy. So now another phrase that we took a look at and it's a way of making conversation especially with a person that you haven't seen in a while. He said, hey, what's new with you? 

**Catherine:** What's new with you? 

**Marco:** Aha, what's new with you? 

**Catherine:** Alright, so this might sound a little strange, because normally we would say "How have you been? It's been a long time". 

**Marco:** How are you? 

**Catherine:** But this is like, you know, it's… it's a fluency builder phrase, so it's very colloquial, it's very spoken language. So this you hear often between friends… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Or family members. Hey, Marco, what's new with you? 

**Marco:** So how do you… I would answer this by saying "Oh, well, not much" or, uh, "Oh, I just bought a new house", so, basically, you're asking for news. 

**Catherine:** Yes… 

**Marco:** From a person. 

**Catherine:** I haven't seen you for a long time, you look… you look happy and healthy, so what's new with you? Oh, I got married, I got a new car. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** These things that you can say these are changes in my life, uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright, and usually after somebody asks you what's new with you, you say something and then you usually would follow up and ask that person as well, right? What's new… And what's new with you? 

**Catherine:** Exactly, so, you know, I got a new house, got a new job, what's new with YOU? 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or what about you? 

**Catherine:** What about you? So it's a nice, very relaxed, informal way of asking someone for news in their life. 

**Marco:** Perfect, alright, what's new with you? Uh, what else? Now, he was supposed to get married, right? 

**Catherine:** Right, so this is news: he was supposed to get married, he didn't get married. What's going on? His brother, his mother, they all wanna know what's going on and we find out that wedding, that girl, he justcouldn't go through with it. 

**Marco:** Uhu, so I can't… I couldn't go through with it. 

**Catherine:** Okay, this is past tense, so he's saying before I came to India with this girl I couldn't go through with it. 

**Marco:** Uhu, so present would be I can't go through with it. 

**Catherine:** Mm, and going through with what? Here we've got it, so this kind of magical… 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** Strange word it, what it… what could this be? 

**Marco:** So basically, what he's saying is that he couldn't complete or maybe finish something that he started, right? 

**Catherine:** So in this case we're talking about… 

**Marco:** Marriage. 

**Catherine:** A relationship… 

**Marco:** Or marriage. 

**Catherine:** Or marriage. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Or relationship. 

**Catherine:** So… maybe we loved each other, but I couldn't go through with it, I couldn't go to the finish line. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right, I can't get married. You see that a lot when maybe in movies two people are supposed to get married, they're at the altar and all of a sudden the bride says "I can't" or she goes away crying. 

**Catherine:** I can't go through with this. 

**Marco:** Exactly, right. 

**Catherine:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** So, because she loves somebody else, so can't go through with it. 

**Catherine:** Mm, great, so a really good phrase – I can't go through with it, he couldn't go through with it. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Catherine:** And, uh, we find out that, well, not such a bad thing, Steven is very popular in India, the girls love him. We've got a great phrase for describing of having lots of girls who love you. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Right, he says there'll be girls throwing themselves at you. 

**Catherine:** Literally like… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** Ouh, that might have hurt. 

**Marco:** I can't imagine that like just somebody throwing themself at you? 

**Catherine:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** No, it's not literal; it's basically saying girls are very interested in you, girls are so interested in you that they'll be chasing you almost. 

**Catherine:** Alright, so many, many girls, they will… they will follow you, they want to be in a relationship with you, they like you. 

**Marco:** Uhu 

**Catherine:** So he's saying "Listen! There are other girls". 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Don't worry. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** Girls here, they love you. 

**Marco:** And it doesn't only work with girls, right? I can say they'll be boys throwing themselves at you. 

**Catherine:** Right, so this is, uh… this is something we say about both genders - boys and girls. You could say "Oh, god! All the boys were throwing themselves at her, I'm so jealous". 

**Marco:** Hehe. Right, so, but it's only basically in a loving way, right? It can't be anything else like somebody's chasing you for other reasons. 

**Catherine:** No, this is saying that they have pressures, they have feelings, they wanna be romantic. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Catherine:** It's not like… it's not a bad thing, but sometimes it's too much attention, so it can be kind of negative. 

**Marco:** Yeah. Alright, well, interesting phrases on fluency builder today. I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for one last time. 

**Catherine:** Get up and dance! 

**Marco:** Yeah, get up and dance and we'll be back in a little bit. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** 

**Marco:** Aright, so, um, it's over. 

**Catherine:** Uh, sad. 

**Marco:** Ten… 

**Catherine:** Sad, but sweet. 

**Marco:** Sad, but sweet, aha. Ten… well, we went from them meeting casually by a bike accident. 

**Catherine:** Pah-pah-pah. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it… had nice music. Then it turned out… 

**Catherine:** That's so romantic. 

**Marco:** That she was angry, they kind of broke up, they got back together. 

**Catherine:** He was being strange with all of these secret trips to save people. 

**Marco:** Uhu. It's a… it was interesting, we went a lot of different ways… 

**Catherine:** She was pregnant, she wasn't really pregnant, she got s… 

**Marco:** But doctor was stalking her. 

**Catherine:** Stalker. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Yeah. 

**Catherine:** He's in the secret service. 

**Marco:** It was an interesting ride. 

**Catherine:** Mm, very interesting, but… 

**Marco:** Well, now we need to, uh, think of a new, um, drama, a new, uh soap opera or novel, so, um, we need your input. 

**Catherine:** Maybe we should open it up. What did you like? What didn't you like? And what kind of genre… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Are you interested in? Because, you know, there's tons of different kinds of stories we could tell. 

**Marco:** Right, maybe we can do, um, something scary like a thriller or horror. 

**Catherine:** I'm a big fan of sci-fi. 

**Marco:** Yeah, or sci-fi, maybe we can do something sci-fi. 

**Catherine:** Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh. 

**Marco:** Maybe we can do a comedy, something maybe like Friends, I don't know. 

**Catherine:** That'd be kind of cute. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it could be. Alright, so, listeners, why don't you give us your input? We need your feedback. Tell us what series you would like next, what type of series. Maybe like we sad drama, sci-fi, action, what… what would you like?
