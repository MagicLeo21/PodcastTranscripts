## At the Airport

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're gonna be taking you to the airport. 

**Erica:** That's right. We're gonna listen as a man, um, checks in at the airport and, uh, deals with his luggage. 

**Marco:** That's right. So, we're gonna be looking at a lot of great stuff that can help you the next time you are at the airport at the checking counter. So, why don't we take a look at one word that we're gonna preview today in "vocabulary preview"? 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** We're gonna hear this guy say "I'd like to check three pieces". 

**Marco:** He's gonna check three pieces of what? 

**Erica:** Pieces of luggage. 

**Marco:** So, when we talk about luggage we can say pieces of luggage. 

**Erica:** That's right. Luggage is a non-count noun. So, you can't say one luggage, two luggages, three luggages - that's wrong. 

**Marco:** Right, so, we use… 

**Erica:** Pieces of luggage. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, three pieces of luggage. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Very good. Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time. We're gonna see what happens with this guy at the airport and with his pieces of luggage. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Erica:** Alright, well, that's a l… whole lot of money, isn't it? 

**Marco:** Well, I think it's a very common situation. I'm sure many of our listeners can relate to this situation. 

**Erica:** Overweight charges are pretty expensive wh… 

**Marco:** Very high. 

**Erica:** I know from personal experience. But that's not what we wanna talk about. Now we wanna talk about some really useful vocabulary in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Alright, on language takeaway today we have five words. So, why don't we start with the first one? 

**Erica:** So, the woman asked: "will you be checking any begs today?" 

**Marco:** Will you be checking any bags today? 

**Erica:** To check bags. 

**Marco:** Right, so, the verb to check. 

**Erica:** It means to, uh, to give your bags to the airline, to register them. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that's what happens with your luggage. You check them, so, basically, they become responsible for your bags. 

**Erica:** Right. It reminds me of checking in to a hotel. 

**Marco:** Right, very similar. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** When you go to a hotel you register at the hotel, you check in. In this case you just check your luggage. 

**Erica:** You don't check in you luggage. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, check luggage. 

**Marco:** So, he wanted to check three pieces of luggage and he also had carry-on luggage. 

**Erica:** Carry-on luggage. 

**Marco:** Carry-on. 

**Erica:** So, carry-on luggage; it's pretty simple. 

**Marco:** That's right, you carry it on yourself. 

**Erica:** Exactly, you carry it on to the plane. Now, we… 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** We can talk about carry-on luggage, right? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Or a carry-on bag. 

**Marco:** Right, or a carry-on suitcase. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** A very small suitcase that can fit under your seat. 

**Erica:** Exactly. Alright, so, carry-on luggage. Now, he was traveling on an intercontinental flight. 

**Marco:** Intercontinental. 

**Erica:** Intercontinental. 

**Marco:** We have two words there – inter… 

**Erica:** Between. 

**Marco:** Between, right? And continental… 

**Erica:** So, this sounds like continent. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, he's traveling maybe form Asia… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** To… North America. 

**Erica:** Okay, intercontinental. 

**Marco:** He's trying to board this intercontinental flight. 

**Erica:** So, to board a flight. 

**Marco:** Board a plane. 

**Erica:** Board a train. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, basically it means to… 

**Erica:** To get on. 

**Marco:** To get on. 

**Erica:** To get on a vehicle. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I can say board the ship. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Board the car. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** No? 

**Erica:** No, but board the… board the train. 

**Marco:** Board the train. 

**Erica:** Board the bus. All aboard! 

**Marco:** That's right. That's why in movies you see that somebody will yell "all aboard". 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** In the train station, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** All aboard! Okay, so, board a vehicle. And our last phrase for today – overhead compartment. [NOTE: you can also say overhead bin] 

**Erica:** Overhead compartment. 

**Marco:** Overhead compartment. 

**Erica:** Alright, let's break this phrase down. Um, overhead… 

**Marco:** So, that's on top of your head, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly, yeah. 

**Marco:** Above you. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and the compartment is, um, a place where you can put something and store it. 

[NOTE: you can also say "to stow your luggage in the overhead compartment" instead of "to put"] 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Kind of like a box. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, you have an overhead compartment that… big box where you put your bags and your purse or whatever on an airplane. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Very similar of two… for example, an overhead projector. 

**Erica:** Right, so, that's the machine that, uh, puts an image or a picture on a wall like sometimes you see them in meetings. 

**Marco:** Right, so, because the image is over your head… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And it's big, it's called an overhead projector. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, some great language. Why don't we hear it again in context by listening to the dialogue for the second time? 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Alright, so, I think it's a little bit more clear now. And with this it's time for us to take a look at some great phrases in "putting in together". 

**Putting It Together** 

**Erica:** So, this guy was pretty angry about, uh, this airline policy and he said "how am I supposed to…" 

**Marco:** How am I supposed to. 

**Erica:** How am I supposed to. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, before we get into explaining this, why don't we listen to a couple of examples? So, we can try and understand what it means? 

**Example One** 

> A: How am I supposed to fit the dog in the car? There're ten people in there already. 

**Example Two** 

> B: How's she supposed to get to work if her car is in the shop? 

**Example Three** 

> C: How're we supposed to know the answer to that? It's impossible! 

**Erica:** Okay, so, I… can understand that it means "how can I do this?" 

**Marco:** Right. How do you expect me to do this? 

**Erica:** How is this possible for me to do this? 

**Marco:** Very good. 

**Erica:** It's a phrase you use when you're frustrated, right? 

**Marco:** Yeah, exactly, you're maybe a little bit frustrated or you're maybe nervous of… of something that you can't do or don't know how. 

**Erica:** Yeah, this phrase… it's not impolite, but it sort of gives the idea that you're challenging the other person a little bit. 

**Marco:** Maybe, yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, a good phrase that you can use on… in different situations and you can try and mix it up with different verbs, right? 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** Alright. Now, let's take a look at our next phrase: "I'm sorry, sir, there's nothing I can do". 

**Erica:** There's nothing I can do. 

**Marco:** There's nothing I can do. 

**Erica:** There's nothing I can do. 

**Marco:** So, basically, the woman can't help the man even though he's insisting and he's pushing that he wants another solution. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Right? So, finally, she says "I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do". 

**Erica:** So, we use this phrase, um, when someone's pushing you too much, right? 

**Marco:** Right, and you would use it only in that situation… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Towards them, because it is a little bit… 

**Erica:** It… it's strong. 

**Marco:** It's not impolite, but it's just… you're saying "you know what? I'm sorry, there's… th… I can't do anything about it". Now, let's move on to our third phrase: "You charge next to nothing". 

**Erica:** Next to nothing. 

**Marco:** Next to nothing. 

**Erica:** Next to nothing. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, we're talking about charging, we're talking about money. Why don't we listen to some examples of what this next to nothing phrase means? 

**Example One** 

> A: Do you like my new house? It was so cheap that it almost cost next to nothing. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Let's go to Thailand; tickets costs next to nothing right now. 

**Example Three** 

> C: The real estate agent charged me next to nothing for his commission, so I got a really good deal. 

**Erica:** So, when something costs next to nothing it's really cheap, right? 

**Marco:** It's really cheap. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or you consider it to be cheap. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And now, for our last phrase, it's the complete opposite of next to nothing. 

**Erica:** Right, charge an arm and a leg. 

**Marco:** An arm and a leg. 

**Erica:** An arm and a leg. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, this means it's really expensive. 

**Erica:** It's so expensive it's like giving your arm and your leg. 

**Marco:** Right, to pay for it. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Very good, so, next to nothing – really cheap; an arm and a leg – really expensive. 

**Erica:** Can we look at the use here? Um, alright, so, in the dialogue we heard "you charge an arm and a leg", but we can also say "it costs an arm and a leg". 

**Marco:** Right, because we are referring to money. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Alright, so, some great phrases here. Now, I think it's time we listen to our dialogue one more time. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, airline policies, luggage - it's always a problem, right? Most of the time you always end up paying overweight, when you travel. 

**Erica:** Yeah, um, I know that this happened to me once and it was really expensive. 

**Marco:** Really? What happened? 

**Erica:** I was flying on an intercontinental flight from… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** From India back to Europe and, um, I had too many extra begs, but I really need it to bring them and so, it cost me six thousand dollars! 

**Marco:** Six thousand dollars. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Wow! 

**Erica:** So, my credit card was pretty maxed out after that. 

**Marco:** Hehe. That's incredible. 

**Erica:** Yeah.
