---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** We're bringing you a great elementary podcast today. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** And we're gonna be teaching you how to order pizza. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you know, pizza is one of my favorite foods and the favorite food of many people. 

**Marco:** Exactly, it's one of those common foods that you're at home and you want to order something to eat. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** And the typical thing is pizza. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but you know there's some very special language that you've gotta use, you've gotta know this language, ah, when you want to order a pizza. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, let's listen to this dialogue for the first time as a man is ordering pizza. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, so I guess he is not getting his pizza. 

**Erica:** No, he forgot to give his address. 

**Marco:** That's a bit of a problem. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's take a look at some of the vocabulary in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, we've got some great pizza words for you today, um, and our first one we have is a medium pizza. 

**Marco:** Medium pizza. 

**Erica:** Medium pizza. 

**Marco:** So, that's the size, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Medium. You can say medium or… 

**Erica:** Twelve inch. 

**Marco:** Twelve inch. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Usually a medium pizza is twelve inches. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so you could say "I'd like a twelve inch pizza". 

**Marco:** Okay, for those of us who use centimeters this would be more or less thirty centimeters. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, let's take a look at the next size. A large pizza. 

**Erica:** Large pizza. 

**Marco:** A large pizza. 

**Erica:** So, it might also be called an eighteen inch… 

**Marco:** An eighteen inch pizza. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Or isn't it sometimes called a family size? 

**Erica:** Maybe. 

**Marco:** Family size. 

**Erica:** I guess it depends where you're ordering. 

**Marco:** Yeah. Okay, so large and medium pizzas. Now, let's take a look at some of the ingredients. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, we have pepperoni. 

**Erica:** Pepperoni. 

**Marco:** Pepperoni. 

**Erica:** Pepperoni. 

**Marco:** This is the common ingredient of pizza. 

**Erica:** It's my favorite. Um, a pizza is not a pizza unless it has pepperoni. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, so, pepperoni is like… is a sausage, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's a little bit spicy. 

**Marco:** A little bit spicy. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And they look like, ah… 

**Erica:** Like circles. 

**Marco:** Red circles. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay. Olives. 

**Erica:** Olives. 

**Marco:** Olives. 

**Erica:** Olives. 

**Marco:** Olives are little black or green balls. 

**Erica:** Yes, little green or black balls you… you can also find them in a Martini. [NOTE: Coctail Martitni] 

**Marco:** Yeah, exactly. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** It's very common for them to have… it's very common to have an… it's very common to have an olive in a Martini. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay. And he also ordered extra cheese. 

**Erica:** Extra cheese. 

**Marco:** So, that means more cheese. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Extra. 

**Erica:** Alright, another ingredient - ham. 

**Marco:** Ham. 

**Erica:** Ham. The meat of a pig. 

**Marco:** Yeah, ham. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay. And he also ordered another strange ingredient for the pizza - pineapple. 

**Erica:** Pineapple. 

**Marco:** Pineapple. 

**Erica:** Pineapple. 

**Marco:** Now, this is a fruit. 

**Erica:** I know, so weird to put pineapple on a pizza. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Many people like pineapple on a… on their pizza. It's a tropical fruit. 

**Erica:** Yep, comes from Hawaii. 

**Marco:** Usually. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And it kind of looks like a little palm tree at the top. 

**Erica:** Yeah, like a… yeah, the top of a pineapple looks like a tree. 

**Marco:** Uhu. So, pineapple. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Aright, now, the last description of a pizza. He ordered it with thin crust. 

**Erica:** Thin crust. 

**Marco:** Thin crust. 

**Erica:** Thin crust. 

**Marco:** Now, we know thin is some… 

**Erica:** Skinny. 

**Marco:** Skinny. But crust. What is crust? 

**Erica:** It's the bread part of the pizza. 

**Marco:** The outside part. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, so that's the crust. 

**Erica:** That's my favorite part of the pizza. 

**Marco:** Really? 

**Erica:** Yeah, mmm. 

**Marco:** Thin crust or thick crust. 

**Erica:** Ah, thin crust… yeah, thin crust and I just… I really love that bread part. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Erica:** It's so important to a good pizza. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, well, you know they also have, um… they also have the crust filled with cheese. 

**Erica:** I know, it so wrong. 

**Marco:** That's good too. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Okay, now we have some really polite language that you could use possibly with customers or with clients. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, so let's take a look at them in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** Okay, my… Alright, the first phrase we have, um, I think is my favorite. This is the way that Marty answered the phone, right? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** He said this is Marty speaking. 

**Marco:** This is Marty speaking. 

**Erica:** This is Marty speaking. 

**Marco:** Now, why is this so important? 

**Erica:** Cause a lot of people when they answer the phones say "I'm Erica…" 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Like "hello, I'm Erica". 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Which is not what English people say. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** We always say "Erica speaking". 

**Marco:** Uhu, "this is Erica speaking". 

**Erica:** Exactly. So, guys, remember this, you'll sound really really great when you use this on the phone. This is Marty speaking. 

**Marco:** Exactly. This is Marty… oh, don't use Marty. Use your name. 

**Erica:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright. Then he also mentioned a two for one special. 

**Erica:** Two for one special. 

**Marco:** A two for one special. So, that means you're getting two… 

**Erica:** Pizzas, right? 

**Marco:** For the price of one. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** And a special is just a special promotion. 

**Erica:** A special price. 

**Marco:** Special price. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Two for one special. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** Alright, now very easy phrase. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Would you like? 

**Erica:** Would you like? 

**Marco:** Would you like? 

**Erica:** Would you like? 

**Marco:** Now, this is a great way to offer something. 

**Erica:** It's a more polite way of asking do you want. 

**Marco:** Do you want. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Do you want is… is okay. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's fine. 

**Marco:** But I… it's less polite then would you like. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** So, whenever you offer something "would you like a cup of coffee". 

**Erica:** "Would you like to sit down". 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** So, would you like. Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk about pizza from a pizza expert. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, we're back and we are here with our pizza exper, who else, but Marco from ItalianPod. M1: Hi, everyone. 

**Erica:** Marco Two, right? M1: Marco One. 

**Marco:** I'm Marco Zero, he's Marco One. M1: Yes. 

**Erica:** Alright. 

**Marco:** We've come to an agreement. M1: So, Zero, wha… what's the deal about this pizza thing? 

**Marco:** We're talking about pizza today and we want to know what's your opinion since pizza comes from Italy, right? M1: Well, thanks for the question first, ah, Marco Zero. Is my mic working? 

**Marco:** It should be. 

**Erica:** Yes. M1: Okay, so, ah, the problem with pizza is that, ah… yes, it comes from Italy… originate it…the story goes… what was then? 

**Marco:** Right. M1: ??? Regina Margarita, Queen Margarita. 

**Marco:** Alright. M1: But the problem is that now this confusion worldwide, pizza and Pizza Hut, American pizza, Italian pizza, that is not the same thing. 

**Marco:** It's not the same. M1: It's not the same. 

**Marco:** Okay. M1: Have you… 

**Marco:** So, Pizza Hut isn't Italian pizza. M1: Not… No… ??? So that… th… okay, here it goes, hm, Italians are little better… Italians make food but they're not good at branding it. 

**Marco:** Okay. M1: Americans are very good at branding their food. 

**Marco:** Uhu. M1: So they have Starbucks and Pizza Hut and bla-bla-bla… The problem is that since they have to brand it they don't change the name. 

**Marco:** Uh. M1: So they… they do this PIZZA Hut… that is totally different from Am… Italian pizza. What… How is it different? Have you ever seen the… the… two of them? Have you ever compared them? 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah. They are very different. That's true. 

**Erica:** So, okay, can you put pineapple and ham on a pizza? M1: Aaah, tech… technically you could… 

**Erica:** Like it's possible. M1: As long as you call it Hawaiian you can put pineapple in everything, I guess, but the problem… what I'm trying to say that… Okay, Italian pizza is, you know, you have the… the… the flour, the bread, the pasta… not pasta ??? pizza… 

**Erica:** The crust, the crust. M1: The crust, the tomato sauce, and then… then… the… 

**Erica:** Pepperoni. M1: Mozzarella cheese and that's a basic and then you can put on top of it… with some variations. My compito is basically take everything that you have on the table and put this on it. That's a main difference. But… I'm not saying that I'm against the American pizza. I'm saying that you just should change the name. 

**Marco:** To another thing. What do you suggest we should call it? M1: Zippa. 

**Marco:** Zippa. M1: It's close enough. 

**Marco:** Close enough, yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. M1: But it's a different thing. 

**Erica:** But… Maybe you need like an A, like Azippa. M1: Azippa. 

**Marco:** Azippa. 

**Erica:** To indicate that it's American, A for America. 

**Marco:** Uh, maybe. M1: A.Zippa. 

**Erica:** A.Zippa.com. M1: Uh… Can I have a A.Zippa. 

**Marco:** So, Marco… 

**Erica:** Dot com. M1: A.zippaPod.com. 

**Marco:** So, Marco, I know that, um… that you are very much against having Pizza Hut pizza. M1: Um, I like it as, ah… as an exotic experience, because I like the fact that is… it's so much stuff in it that you can not even tell the difference between the ingredients. 

**Marco:** Hehe. M1: You know, the… they have this super mega supreme… 

**Marco:** Super supreme. M1: Super supreme. 

**Erica:** With cheese in the crust. M1: I don't even know what's inside. 

**Erica:** Yeah. M1: It's great. It's great, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everybody's invited. 

**Marco:** Hehe. M1: That… that's for me the feeling of American pizza. 

**Marco:** Well, another interesting thing when we were eating wh… pizza with Marco is that we noticed the way that people from different countries eat pizza. 

**Erica:** That's right. Italian people fold their pizza. M1: We do fold… a… and another thing is that we have a hold pizza like if I order one pizza it's not like I share it, everybody has a one slice of it. We ordered one pizza, you ordered your pizza, she ordered her pizza and so on. 

**Marco:** Pizza is personal. M1: Pizza's personal. Don't mess with my pizza, Marco Zero. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, well, this whole pizza discussion. Let's see what our listeners have to say about it. I know that we have listeners from all over the world and what do they do with their pizzas. 

**Erica:** Yes. What do you… M1: Or their zippas. 

**Marco:** Or their zippas. 

**Erica:** What do you like on your pizza? 

**Marco:** Exactly, for example, I… M1: How height you want the crust to be? 

**Erica:** Thin. 

**Marco:** How high? 

**Erica:** Thin. 

**Marco:** I know that, for example… M1: How thin you want your crust to be? 

**Marco:** I know that, for example, in some countries they put ketchup on their pizza. M1: I know! Once I was, ah, eating pizza… look… I had the Japanese friend who ordered the pizza from Pizza Hut and… the pizza had the pineapple and other staff on it and then she took out like ketchup and mayonnaise… 

**Erica:** Oh, no. M1: And she got [it] like wild. Haaah! 

**Erica:** Although I must tell you I like Tabasco on my pizza and I know that's wrong, I know. I'm sorry. M1: Yes…yeah…what… You do what you have to do, Erica, then, you know, history will judge you for that. 

**Marco:** Alright, we better go, we're out of time and before Marco has a heart attack or an aneurysm or something we're making him angry here. And if you have any questions for us and also for Marco, because I'm sure he's gonna be, ah, commenting on this aspect… M1: Ah, sure.
