**Marco:** Hello everyone! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you the second part of Christmas Chronicles. 

**Erica:** Another Christmas lesson to get you in the Christmas spirit. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Christmas and useful language for all our listeners today. 

**Erica:** That's right, in today's lesson we'll be learning some great Christmas vocabulary. 

**Marco:** And police related vocabulary as well. 

**Erica:** Now, Christmas-police vocabulary, how exactly does that fit together? 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, they don"t. 

**Erica:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** But here at EnglishPod we can make anything happen, so, that's why we have done this. 

**Erica:** To be creative. 

**Marco:** To be creative. So, let's take a look at our "vocabulary preview" for this lesson. 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** In today's vocabulary preview we"ve got two words from our dialogue that you will need to know to understand this dialogue. 

**Marco:** Uhu, the first one is elves. 

**Erica:** Elves. 

**Marco:** Elves. 

**Erica:** Elves, and this is the plural of the word elf. 

**Marco:** Elf, right. 

**Erica:** So, elves are… 

**Marco:** Little people. Hehe. 

**Erica:** Little people with pointy hats. 

**Marco:** With pointy hats; Santa's helpers. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, elves. 

**Marco:** Elves. 

**Erica:** Our next word is candy cane. 

**Marco:** Candy cane. 

**Erica:** Candy cane. 

**Marco:** Candy cane. 

**Erica:** So, a candy cane is a traditional Christmas candy, right? 

**Marco:** Yes, it's red and white. 

**Erica:** And it's kind of shaped like a… like a "J". 

**Marco:** Like a "J", yeah. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, it… 

**Marco:** It's very traditional. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you… you hang them on a tree and you eat them at Christmas time. 

**Marco:** Yes. 

**Erica:** Taste like peppermint. 

**Marco:** Okay, well, I guess we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the first time, uh, and it's gonna be kind of fast, but… 

**Erica:** Don't worry if you don't understand everything, because we'll come back and talk about some of the language later. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

> A: Really, gentlemen, you can't take me to jail! Don't you know who I am? Kris Kringle, you know, Papa Noel, Pere Noel, Babbo Natale, sheng dan lao ren!

> B: Yeah, Yeah, we've heard that one before, haven't we Joe?

> C: Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy! Can you believe that?

> A: It's Christmas Eve and I have all these Presents to deliver! Where is your Christmas spirit? What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their stockings?

> B: Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no-parking zone, you were speeding, and you have no ID!

> C: Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh has been impounded and those reindeer were taken to the city zoo.

> A: What! This is unbelievable! What's this world coming to? Christmas is ruined!

> C: What's that up ahead? It looks like… elves!! Elves!! Whoa, they're shooting candy canes! Mayday, Mayday, we are under heavy attack! We need backup!

**Marco:** Okay, so, Santa has escaped from the police car, hey? 

**Erica:** Thank God! 

**Marco:** It's like a war over there. They were really firing everything. 

**Erica:** I know, I mean those elves are… 

**Marco:** Aggressive. 

**Erica:** Very aggressive. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, well, we can take a look at some great vocabulary from this dialogue. Why don't we start with our "language takeaway" for today? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** In today's language takeaway we have five really important words that we hope you will take away from the lesson. 

**Marco:** Exactly, and the first word that we have today is booked. 

**Erica:** Booked. 

**Marco:** Booked. 

**Erica:** Booked. 

**Marco:** Booked is another way of saying… 

**Erica:** Arrested. 

**Marco:** Arrested. 

**Erica:** Yeah, it's a slang word, hey? 

**Marco:** It's kind of slangy, yeah. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's a slang word – booked. 

**Erica:** Okay, next word – speeding. 

**Marco:** Speeding. 

**Erica:** Speeding. 

**Marco:** Speeding. 

**Erica:** So, Santa was speeding, because he was… 

**Marco:** Going too fast. 

**Erica:** Driving too fast, yeah. 

**Marco:** Right… 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Going over the speed limit. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Third word today is… 

**Marco:** Impounded. 

**Erica:** Impounded. 

**Marco:** Impounded… 

**Erica:** Hm. 

**Marco:** That's when your car gets arrested. 

**Erica:** Your car gets arrested? 

**Marco:** Hehe. Yeah, they take your car to "car jail". 

**Erica:** Okay, so, my car is in "car jail". 

**Marco:** It"s… 

**Erica:** I think I understand. 

**Marco:** It's impounded. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, the police take my car and I have to… 

**Marco:** Pay to get it out. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Let's move to our next word – ruined. 

**Marco:** Ruined. 

**Erica:** Ruined. 

**Marco:** Ruined. 

**Erica:** We have a few examples for us to listen to, to understand the meaning of this word. 

**Example One** 

> A: It's been raining for five days. Our vacation is ruined. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Look at this hole! You've ruined my favorite pair of jeans. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Sam, you've been caught steeling from the company, your chances for a promotion are ruined. 

**Marco:** Okay, great examples and basically ruined means… 

**Erica:** Destroyed. 

**Marco:** Destroyed. 

**Erica:** Yeah, messed up. 

**Marco:** Messed up, okay. Now for our last word – back up. Backup. 

**Erica:** Oh, yeah… 

**Marco:** So, now for our last word… Okay, so, now for our last word on language takeaway – backup. 

**Erica:** Backup. 

**Marco:** Backup. 

**Erica:** Backup. 

**Marco:** So, backup is… 

**Erica:** Help. 

**Marco:** Help. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** So, when you call for backup, you call for help. 

**Marco:** Call for help. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Yeah, you see it all the time in war movies, police "Call for backup!" 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** I think though it's important to point out that here the pronunciation and stress of this phrase is really important, hey? 

**Marco:** Uhu, yes, yes. 

**Erica:** You have to say backup. 

**Marco:** Backup. 

**Erica:** Backup. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** So, both words are stressed at about the same level, hey? 

**Marco:** Uhu, backup. 

**Erica:** Cause if you were to say back up… 

**Marco:** That means to move back. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's different, so, backup, back up. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** The stress is important. 

**Marco:** The stress ??? 

**Erica:** Alright, well, you know what? I think with those words in mind it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

> A: Really, gentlemen, you can't take me to jail! Don't you know who I am? Kris Kringle, you know, Papa Noel, Pere Noel, Babbo Natale, sheng dan lao ren!

> B: Yeah, Yeah, we've heard that one before, haven't we Joe?

> C: Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy! Can you believe that?

> A: It's Christmas Eve and I have all these Presents to deliver! Where is your Christmas spirit? What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their stockings?

> B: Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no-parking zone, you were speeding, and you have no ID!

> C: Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh has been impounded and those reindeer were taken to the city zoo.

> A: What! This is unbelievable! What's this world coming to? Christmas is ruined!

> C: What's that up ahead? It looks like… elves!! Elves!! Whoa, they're shooting candy canes! Mayday, Mayday, we are under heavy attack! We need backup!

**Marco:** Okay, so, without the sound effects and without any noise I think it's much more clear now, right? 

**Erica:** A little less dramatic. 

**Marco:** Less dramatic, but good language. 

**Erica:** Yes, speaking of good language, there're some great phrases I wanna look at in this dialogue and, so, let's do that in "putting it together". 

**Putting It Together** 

**Erica:** We have two phrases in putting it together that we want to show you how you can use in many different situations. In the dialogue we heard this… Phrase: Last week we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy. Last week we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy. 

**Erica:** So, when you claim to be something, you're saying that you are something, but it might not be true, right? 

**Marco:** Right, so, for example, you can say "This woman claimed to be your wife". 

**Erica:** But she's not. 

**Marco:** Bu she's not. 

**Erica:** Okay, we have a few other examples of how you can use the phrase claim to. 

**Example One** 

> A: Daniel claimed to be the son of a Government Minister, but later we found out that he was lying. 

**Example Two** 

> B: The criminals claimed to have a gun! 

**Example Three** 

> C: This man here, he's claiming to know your father. 

**Erica:** That's such a great phrase, just by putting it together with another verb means something different, but still expresses that same idea. 

**Marco:** Right, claim to have… She claimed to have a baby or something. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, let's move to our next phrase… 

**Marco:** Under heavy. 

**Erica:** Under heavy. 

**Marco:** Under heavy. 

**Erica:** So, in the dialogue they said "we're under heavy attack". 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** You can also use this phrase in a couple of other ways. 

**Example One** 

> A: We're under heavy attack! 

**Example Two** 

> B: We're under heavy fire! 

**Example Three** 

> C: The Prime Minister is under heavy security. 

**Erica:** So, if you're under heavy fire… 

**Marco:** Means that there's a lot of fire. 

**Erica:** Like gun fire. 

**Marco:** Gun fire, yeah. 

**Erica:** Yean, and not like fire fire. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Erica:** Okay, and if you're under heavy security… 

**Marco:** It means that you have a lot of security, a lot of bodyguards or a lot of… 

**Erica:** Right, like a Prime Minister, a President would be under heavy security. 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Couple of great phrases. 

**Marco:** Really good phrases and with this we can listen to our dialogue a third time. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

> A: Really, gentlemen, you can't take me to jail! Don't you know who I am? Kris Kringle, you know, Papa Noel, Pere Noel, Babbo Natale, sheng dan lao ren!

> B: Yeah, Yeah, we've heard that one before, haven't we Joe?

> C: Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy! Can you believe that?

> A: It's Christmas Eve and I have all these Presents to deliver! Where is your Christmas spirit? What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their stockings?

> B: Sorry buddy, you were parked in a no-parking zone, you were speeding, and you have no ID!

> C: Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh has been impounded and those reindeer were taken to the city zoo.

> A: What! This is unbelievable! What's this world coming to? Christmas is ruined!

> C: What's that up ahead? It looks like… elves!! Elves!! Whoa, they're shooting candy canes! Mayday, Mayday, we are under heavy attack! We need backup!

**Erica:** So, Marco, the police mentioned something about the Tooth Fairy. 

**Marco:** The Tooth Fairy. 

**Erica:** I don't know, maybe some of our listeners don't know the story about the Tooth Fairy, so, um… Can I go ahead and say it? 

**Marco:** Yes, go ahead. 

**Erica:** Okay, well, when you're small and you lose a tooth. 

**Marco:** Your baby teeth. 

**Erica:** Yeah, you put it underneath your pillow. 

**Marco:** Aha. 

**Erica:** And then you go to sleep. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And then in the night the Tooth Fairy comes into the house… flies into the house, snicks under your pillow, takes the tooth and puts money there. 

**Marco:** Uh, I see. 

**Erica:** So, this is the story that parents tell their kids about what happens to their baby teeth. 

**Marco:** And they get money in exchange for it. 

**Erica:** Right, so, I guess it takes away the sadness of losing that tooth. 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah. But in South America, for example, we have the tooth mouse. 

**Erica:** The tooth mouse. 

**Marco:** Yes… 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** The tooth mouse. 

**Erica:** What… what is… how is it called in… in Spanish? 

**Marco:** Oh, well, some… in some places it's called Ratoncito Pérez. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Like, it has a last name Pérez. 

**Erica:** Oh, really? 

**Marco:** Uh, in other places it's just called Ratoncito, Raton, which means mouse. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, it would be like Tooth Fairy Smith. 

**Marco:** To… yeah, Tooth Fairy Smith. And it's the same thing, it's a little mouse, it comes in and steels the little tooth from you and leaves money in exchange. 

**Erica:** Cool! Very cool! 

**Marco:** Yeah, yeah. 

**Erica:** So, we go from Santa Clause, uh, to guns and wars, to the Tooth Fairy. 

**Marco:** Only at EnglishPod. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Hehe.
