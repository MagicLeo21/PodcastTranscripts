## This Is Your Captain Speaking

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we have a great lesson for all our upper intermediate students. 

**Erica:** That's right. We're talking about airplane travel today. 

**Marco:** Airplane travel. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right. So, we're gonna be in an airplane, basically. 

**Erica:** Yes, and we're gonna be listening, um, to some of the common things you might hear on, ah, an announcement in the airplane. 

**Marco:** Yeah, usually the flight attendant or the captain will come on and say something and, well, usually it's in English, so we gotta understand what they're saying. 

**Erica:** That's right, and we'll also learn some great phrases that you can use when you wanna describe flights to your friends… 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** When you're talking to them. 

**Marco:** Yeah, that always happens you arrive somewhere and people are like, hey, how was you flight? Now you know how to answer it, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay. So, why don't we take a look at our "vocabulary preview"? 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** We've got three words for you here in vocabulary preview all about flying. 

**Marco:** Okay, so what's our first one? 

**Erica:** Turbulence. 

**Marco:** Turbulence. 

**Erica:** Turbulence. 

**Marco:** Turbulence. 

**Erica:** So, turbulence. How can we describe this? 

**Marco:** Well, turbulence, when you're in an airplane, basically is air that is moving in all directions really fast. 

**Erica:** Okay, so what happens? 

**Marco:** So, the airplane will start to shake. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** It's the same thing if you're flying a kite and maybe some turbulence is in the air your kite will maybe fall to the ground. 

**Erica:** Ouh, ex… 

**Marco:** Yeah. So it's… air that's moving in all directions that's really turbulent. 

**Erica:** Alright, well, we'll hear how this word is used in the dialogue, um… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** But another airplane word we hear a lot, um, crew. 

**Marco:** Crew. 

**Erica:** Crew. 

**Marco:** Flight crew. 

**Erica:** Yes. C-R-E-W, crew. 

**Marco:** Uhu. So, the flight crew is basically the team. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** It's, ah, all the people that are in the airplane. So, it's basically the captain or in… the co-pilot and all the flight attendants, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly, yeah. 

**Marco:** That's the flight crew. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, and what about out last word? 

**Erica:** Bumpy ride. 

**Marco:** Bumpy ride. 

**Erica:** A bumpy ride. 

**Marco:** Bumpy. 

**Erica:** Not smooth. 

**Marco:** Not smooth. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, what would be an example of a bumpy ride? 

**Erica:** Okay, imagine if you're driving in your car, um… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And you you're driving on a dirt road… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Like with many holes in it and everything. 

**Marco:** And rocks and everything. 

**Erica:** Yes, you're driving on that route and that would be really really bumpy. 

**Marco:** Right, so your car will be moving a lot. 

**Erica:** And shaking, yeah… 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Erica:** Yeah. So a bumpy ride is, um, a trip where you move and shake a lot, so… kind of uncomfortable. 

**Marco:** So you can say, that is a bumpy road. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Or it was a bumpy ride. 

**Marco:** Or it was a bumpy ride. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue, we're gonna be listening to these people on an airplane and the captain is gonna give some instructions. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Erica:** Well, here we are with another dramatic dialogue, another explosion in EnglishPod. What's happening? 

**Marco:** Um, I don't know, a lot of adventure's going on. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, we will see what happens, um, but I'm sure they're alright. Don't worry everyone, I'm sure… 

**Erica:** Well, I hope so. It's kind of making me nervous for my next flight. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright, so let's take a look at some of the words that the captain used in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** Alright, all of these words you'll hear really really often when you're flying, um, and the first one we have for you is fasten. 

**Marco:** Fasten. 

**Erica:** Fasten. 

**Marco:** Fasten you seatbelt. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Now, this is a great word, fasten means to… 

**Erica:** Do up. 

**Marco:** Do up or put on or… 

**Erica:** Connect. 

**Marco:** Connect, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, usually it'll be with a seatbelt or a belt or something like that. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. Now, the pronunciation here is interesting. 

**Marco:** Yes. 

**Erica:** It's spelled F-A-S-T-E-N. 

**Marco:** Right, so it would be FAST EN. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** No, right? Hehe. 

**Erica:** Fasen. 

**Marco:** Fasen. The T… 

**Erica:** Fasen. 

**Marco:** Kind of become silent. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, it's fasen. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's look at our next word, lavatory. 

**Erica:** Lavatory. 

**Marco:** Lavatory. 

**Erica:** Lavatory. 

**Marco:** Okay, so what is a lavatory exactly? Cause I'm always confused what's the difference between bathroom, restroom, washroom, WC, lavatory. 

**Erica:** I know, so many words for bathroom, um, a lavatory is a room with a toilet and sink only. 

**Marco:** Only a toilet and sink. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So no bath-tub. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** So it's… 

**Erica:** No shower either. 

**Marco:** No shower. So it's very very common to find a lavatory in boats… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Airplanes. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or in trains. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but never in your house. 

**Marco:** Never in your house, right. 

**Erica:** Even if your room in your house is only a sink and a toilet it's don't let a lavatory. 

**Marco:** Yeah, it's, ah, a bathroom. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** I don't know why, that's just the way it is in English. 

**Marco:** And something interesting that you told me today… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** WC. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Right? That's a common thing that you'll see on a bathroom. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** What does that stand for? 

**Erica:** Water closet. 

**Marco:** Water closet. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Wow, I didn't know that. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Water closet. Okay, anyways. Let's take a look at our next word, stow. 

**Erica:** Stow. 

**Marco:** To stow. 

**Erica:** Yes, stow your luggage. 

**Marco:** Stow your luggage. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So if I stow my luggage it means… 

**Erica:** You put it in a place where you can get it easily, but it is very safe. 

**Marco:** Maybe it's not even visible, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, so you put it away in a safe spot. 

**Marco:** Okay, so usually in airplanes they will tell you to stow your luggage under your seat… 

**Erica:** Yes, or stow your luggage in the overhead bin. 

**Marco:** Overhead bin or overhead compartment. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, and our last word. 

**Erica:** Refrain. 

**Marco:** Refrain. 

**Erica:** Refrain. 

**Marco:** Refrain from doing something. 

**Erica:** Uhu, so this is a verb, um, meaning avoid doing. 

**Marco:** Avoid doing. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Do not do. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Something interesting about this grammar wise is… it's usually followed by from. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Refrain from, and the verb that follows is always gerund, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, so refrain from –ing. 

**Marco:** Right, refrain from using the lavatory. 

**Erica:** Yes, refrain from smoking. 

**Marco:** Refrain from smoking, okay. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, refrain from. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Alright, so some really great examples in language takeaway. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** And, ah, well, now let's take a look at "fluency builder" and see some of these great phrases. 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Erica:** Alright, three phrases we have for you here, um, the first one, remain seated. 

**Marco:** Remain seated. 

**Erica:** Remain seated. 

**Marco:** Remain seated. So, to remain seated. 

**Erica:** Really simple, to stay sitting. 

**Marco:** To stay on your seat, don't stand up. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** This is really important in airplanes, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, because otherwise if there's turbulence you could, you know, end up flying around the airplane. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Or fall, exactly… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And hurt yourself. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Remain seated. 

**Erica:** Now, one of the reasons they had to remain seated was because they were going to go through a patch of rough air. 

**Marco:** Patch of rough air. 

**Erica:** Uhu, so patch. 

**Marco:** No, interesting, okay, so patch is a small area, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, yeah, so a small are of turbulence. 

**Marco:** A small area of turbulence, now… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** What would be another example of patch? 

**Erica:** Um, maybe, ah, patch of strawberries. 

**Marco:** So, it's like a little strawberry garden, right? 

**Erica:** Yes, or a patch of grass. 

**Marco:** Patch of grass. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Usually in front of your house you have a little patch of grass. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Okay, so patch of and now our last phrase, suspend. 

**Erica:** Suspend. 

**Marco:** Suspend in flight service. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so stop for a short time. 

**Marco:** Stop for a short time. So you could suspend your work. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and if you're going on vacation you could suspend your subscription to the newspaper. 

**Marco:** Uhu. Okay, so suspend, to temporarily stop. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay, so we've covered a lot of vocabulary and some great phases. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, why don't we listen to our dialogue one more time and we'll come back and talk about flying.
