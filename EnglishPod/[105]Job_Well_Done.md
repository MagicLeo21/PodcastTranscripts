## Job Well Done

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name isMarco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** Today we're bringing you a lesson about the office, so, something related to business, right? 

**Erica:** That's right, and in this lesson we're learning, um, language you can use to tell someone they did a good job. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, a job well done. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** You want to praise somebody. 

**Erica:** That's right, so, we're gonna listen in as a manager praises his employee on a presentation. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, before we listen to the dialogue, let's take a look very quickly at "vocabulary preview". 

**Vocabulary Preview** 

**Erica:** Well, we're gonna hear both of these words in the dialogue and the first one is a wiz. 

**Marco:** Wiz. 

**Erica:** To be a wiz. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it's an adjective – somebody is a wiz. [NOTE: might be an adjective, but here, actually, it's a noun] 

**Erica:** That's right and wiz comes from the word wizard. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, kind of like a… like a witch, but a guy-witch. 

**Erica:** Yeah, man-witch, um, but, so, a wiz is someone who is really good at something. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I can say "David is a computer wiz". 

**Erica:** Or "Anthony is a math wiz". 

**Marco:** Okay, so, he is really good at computers or he is really good at math or he knows a lot about math. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, and, uh, our second word. 

**Erica:** Well, we're gonna hear about slides. 

**Marco:** Slides. 

**Erica:** PowerPoint slides. 

**Marco:** PowerPoint slides, okay, so, everyone knows PowerPoint, right? 

**Erica:** Uhu, a computer program. 

**Marco:** A computer program that you use to make presentations. 

**Erica:** And a slide is one page in that presentation. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, if you have ten pages in your PowerPoint presentation, you basically have ten slides. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Very good, so, now let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and we're gonna see what's happening in this business meeting. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Erica:** Alright, well, it sounds like the employee is a little bit, mm, shy or… or embarrassed by receiving all of these compliments. 

**Marco:** Yeah, I guess he is kind of, uh, being humble about it. 

**Erica:** Uhu, exactly! So, why don't we move on to the language now? There're so many really useful phrases in this dialogue, um, that I think we're just gonna focus on those today, so, let's get started with "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, today on fluency builder let's start with our first phrase. The boss was so impressed with the presentation that he said "I wascompletely blown away" [NOTE: actually, the boss was a woman, so… she said] 

**Erica:** To be completely blown away. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, to be completely blown away. 

**Erica:** Or to be blown away. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, what does that mean to be blown away? 

**Erica:** To be surprised, um, and amazed, but in a very positive way. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I can say "I'm surprised", "I'm amazed", uh, but I'm still not very clear on this. Why don't we listen to a couple of examples of how we could use this phrase? 

**Example One** 

> A: Karl blew me away with his knowledge of political science. 

**Example Two** 

> B: I was blown away when I heard that Jennie and Rick had gotten married. They have known each other for less than a month. 

**Example Three** 

> C: My parents were blown away when they found out I had a tattoo. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, I think that's a little bit clearer now and this is a wonderful way to give your praise to someone when they do something really amazing. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, completely blown away. You… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Blew me away. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** Now, what about our second word? 

**Erica:** Well, it's quite similar. Um, the boss said that you really wowed me. 

**Marco:** You wowed me. 

**Erica:** To wow someone. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, it's spelled W-O-W, wow. 

**Erica:** So, when you wow someone, you make that person go wow. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you impress somebody. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** To wow someone. I can use it as a verb. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** You wowed me; I wanna wow you. 

**Erica:** Well, I want you wow me. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, uh, wow! Now, let's take a look at our third phrase. The guy, he's a little bit shy, he's trying to be a little bit humble about, you know, receiving so many compliments, so, he says "Oh, it was nothing". 

**Erica:** It was nothing. 

**Marco:** Really, it was nothing. 

**Erica:** It was nothing. 

**Marco:** So, that's a way of saying "It wasn't hard" or "It's not a big deal". 

**Erica:** It's not that important. 

**Marco:** Exactly, so, if somebody's saying "Wow! Thank you so much for lending me your car", don't worry about it. 

**Erica:** It was nothing. 

**Marco:** It was nothing. 

**Erica:** Yeah, uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** It's k… it's a polite way, actually, to respond to a nice compliment. 

**Marco:** Very good, so, before we move on to our next phrase, let's listen to a couple of examples with it was nothing. 

**Example One** 

> A: Thanks for lending me your car this week. I really appreciate it. 

> B: It's okay really, it was nothing. 

**Example Two** 

> C: I can't believe you organized the surprised birthday party. Thank you so much. 

> D: Don't worry about it, it was nothing. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, I think that's petty clear. Now, our final phrase here for fluency builder. Um, the… the employee said that Kirsten gave him a hand. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, to give someone a hand. 

**Erica:** Give me a hand. 

**Marco:** Give me a hand. 

**Erica:** Basically, to help someone. 

**Marco:** Help me or… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Assist me. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, to help someone… "give me a hand" or "let me give you a hand". 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** Alright, very good, so, great phrases in fluency builder today. I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue for the second time. Uh, we're gonna slow it down a little bit, so, we can catch all these phrases and then we'll come back. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Erica:** Okay, so, like we said before there's a… a lot of really helpful phrases in here, um, and we're gonna look at a few more of these in "putting it together". 

**Putting It Together** 

**Marco:** Okay, so, let's start with the first phrase. Uh, the boss was quite impressed with him and he said "That was quite the presentation". 

**Erica:** That was quite the presentation! 

**Marco:** Alright, quite the presentation. 

**Erica:** So, this phrase quite the presentation, it means "it was good", right? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** It was… it was special. 

**Marco:** It was… it was very good. 

**Erica:** Yep, now, we can shake the noun presentation out and replace it with any other noun. [NOTE: shake out = throw away; put aside] 

**Marco:** Alright, so, I can say "Bob is quite the basketball player". 

**Erica:** Uhu. Why don't we listen now for a few more examples? 

 **Example One** 

> A: I heard you're quite the dancer. Can you teach me some moves? 

**Example Two** 

> B: Karl is quite the ladies man. He is very good when it comes to talking to girls. 

**Example Three** 

> C: Nancy is quite gifted at math. She can solve any math problem you give her. 

**Marco:** So, you're saying in a… in a very good way that something is very good. 

**Erica:** Or special. 

**Marco:** Very special. 

**Erica:** Yep, uhu. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, the boss was very impressed with the employee and he said "And I saw that you took on board my feedback". 

**Erica:** To take on board my feedback. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, take on board something. 

**Erica:** Uhu. So, here my feedback is, uh, my suggestions, right? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** And when you take on board my feedback, you accept my feedback and you use it. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, I can say, for example, uh, "I want you to take on board my ideas". 

**Erica:** Uhu, or "Jenny took on board a few of my suggestions, I was really happy". 

**Marco:** Okay, very good, so, to take on board – to accept and use. 

**Erica:** Alright, so, take on board feedback, take on board suggestion[s], take on board ideas. 

**Marco:** Okay, very good. And we have one more phrase on putting it together today – to think something through. 

**Erica:** To think it through. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, think it through. 

**Erica:** So, here the boss said that he took the time to think through my suggestions. 

**Marco:** Uhu, so, think through. What does that mean? 

**Erica:** Um, to think carefully about all of the details of something. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, to take into consideration all the aspects. 

**Erica:** Right, so, why don't we give an example? 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Um, if you're thinking through a plan, right, you don't just think about the end. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** The outcome. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** You wanna think about all of the small details, the steps in that plan. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, maybe I wanna buy a new car, but… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** It's a lot of money, so… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I really have to think it though. 

**Erica:** So, you have to think carefully about everything that is involved in buying the new car. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Erica:** All the money you're gonna have to, you know, not spend on parties and… 

**Marco:** Exactly, you have to think it through, you have to analyze it very carefully. 

**Erica:** That's right, so, let's give a few examples of how we can use this phrase. "Hey, Marco, have you thought through my suggestions?" 

**Marco:** I can say "You guys are very young, I think you should think it through before you get married". 

**Erica:** Hm, good advise. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, to think it through. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, um, three great phrases and why don't we hear them one more time in our dialogue? 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Okay, great dialogue and, uh, some interesting phrases for giving praise, right? That's I think very important in the workplace. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and, you know what, I read recently that something like 6 out of every 10 employees don't get regular praise from their boss. 

**Marco:** Hm, yeah, it's very important and in some cultures, well, it's not very common to praise or to give positive feedback to their employees. 

**Erica:** Yeah, but I think, um, for… for western employees, actually, it's really important and it helps them work harder, the more… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** The more, um, times they hear "Job well done!" 

**Marco:** Yeah, very good. So, now you have the tools that maybe you can use with your employees or…
