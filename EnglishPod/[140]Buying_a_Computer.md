## Buying a Computer

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Catherine:** And my name is Catherine, so what are we talking about today, Marco? 

**Marco:** Well, we're talking about one of my favorite topics, which arecomputers. 

**Catherine:** Yes, you're a little bit of a nerd. 

**Marco:** Uh, a little bit. 

**Catherine:** Hehe. 

**Marco:** I love computers and technology and everything that's related to it, so, uh, that's what we're gonna be looking at today; maybe we're buying a new computer. 

**Catherine:** Well, I anticipate learning something from this, because there're a lot of those fancy big words that I don't know that have to do with processors, and giga-fingle-tingle things. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** So, uh, that's gonna be coming up in a minute here, but, uh, first let's just jump right in and take a listen to today's dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, we're back. Uh, I think it's a very typical case. You're going to get something fixed and they say: "We can't fix it, you need a new one". 

**Catherine:** Yes and not only a new one, but a bigger and better and faster one. 

**Marco:** And more expensive, obviously. 

**Catherine:** Obviously. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** It's called the upsell. 

**Marco:** The upsell, yeah. 

**Catherine:** Hehe. Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, so there were some very difficult words, I think, because they're very specific, related to technology and computers. So, uh, why don't we look at those now in "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** Alright, so the first word we have today is when something is no longer in use. 

**Catherine:** Okay, so this word is obsolete. 

**Marco:** It's obsolete. 

**Catherine:** Obsolete. We're not just talking about like "oh, I haven't touched that pen in like ten years". We're talking about a piece of technology that is no longer useful, because there's something else that can do a better job. 

**Marco:** Right, and actually not only with, uh, technology. We also have words that are obsolete, right? 

**Catherine:** Uhu, exactly, like thy or thine. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** You or yours. 

**Marco:** Classical English. We don't use "thy" anymore. 

**Catherine:** No. 

**Marco:** But… 

**Catherine:** Thou art very summery today, Marco. 

**Marco:** Hehe. But we don't use that anymore. That's obsolete English, right? 

**Catherine:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Or obsolete words. 

**Catherine:** Exactly, so obsolete means it's no longer of use. We have better and newer things in… in its place. 

**Marco:** Alright, and now moving on, when the salesman was describing the characteristics of the computer, uh, he had… he used some prefixesthat were a little bit strange, right? Like for example, giga-. 

**Catherine:** Giga what? 

**Marco:** Giga. Hehe. 

**Catherine:** Alright, so these are actually prefixes that have to do with numbers and so, this is not just a computer thing, this is a math thing or a science thing, so… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Okay, so we've got three different prefixes. A prefix is something we tack on at the beginning of a word. So we've had… we have, uh,hertz, uh, or byte, right? These are little bits of a computer – byte. 

**Marco:** Right, so you have like megabytes. 

**Catherine:** Megabytes, we've all heard before, that's the smallest here. Uh, we've got megabytes, but bigger than mega, we've got gigabytes. 

**Marco:** A giga… yeah, so now, for example, the… the hard drives are two hundred and fifty gigabytes. 

**Catherine:** You might even hear someone say gigs. We've got a… 

**Marco:** Gigs, yeah. 

**Catherine:** Two hundred fifty gig hard drive. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** But, uh, what's bigger than giga? 

**Marco:** Now it's the terabyte. 

**Catherine:** Ooh, tera sounds like boom-boom-boom-boom… 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** Huge! 

**Marco:** I actually wondered what would happen after, uh, gigabyte, cause so much information already and now it's the terabyte, so it's like one thousand gigabytes. 

**Catherine:** So that's like two hundred movies. 

**Marco:** That's probably more than that. It's amazing… 

**Catherine:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** The amount of storage you can have and how small it actually is. 

**Catherine:** So mega, giga, terra. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** Going from littlest to biggest. 

**Marco:** Alright, uh, and well, he described a four gigahertz processor. 

**Catherine:** Mm, okay, so the processor is our next word and this is actually something that, um… that determines how fast your computer is gonna run. 

**Marco:** So it comes from the word to process, right? 

**Catherine:** Right. 

**Marco:** To like calculate or to think… 

**Catherine:** Do, even. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** To do. So you have different examples like a word processor. 

**Catherine:** Right, so that's like Microsoft Word, it's allows you to make Word documents. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** You can also say to process, uh, data. You're trying to calculate it. 

**Marco:** Uhu, but in this case a processor is like a little brain that's the center of the computer and that's where all the information gets processed. 

**Catherine:** Yeah, so it's the brain of the computer, essentially. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** And the bigger it is, the faster it can go. 

**Marco:** Exactly. And, well, if you don't have a very good processor, your computer is bound to freeze. 

**Catherine:** Ooh, okay, so freezing is another keyword, especially when we talk about computers this one drives me nuts. Uh, to freeze, uh, it means to stop moving. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** Right, so, uh, well, it has a couple of different meanings. You might have heard it about ice before, but… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** To freeze here we're talking about stopping moving, so we have a… a game called freeze tag. 

**Marco:** Mm. 

**Catherine:** If I touch you, you have to stop running. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** Uh, but here we're talking about computer freezing. I'm moving my mouse and I'm typing and all of a sudden… 

**Marco:** It doesn't work anymore. 

**Catherine:** My… my mouse doesn't move. I can't close or open or do anything and it's really frustrating. 

**Marco:** It's very… especially if you're doing something and you didn't save your work, it's gone. 

**Catherine:** Huh-huh. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Right, so if your computer freezes, then usually you have to restart it… 

**Catherine:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Or turn it off and on. 

**Catherine:** So that is, uh, about it for those words, but let's take another listen and slow the dialogue down this time, so you can catch some of those big words. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Catherine:** Great, so we are back, so now let's jump into today's "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** Alright, so on fluency builder we're gonna take a look at three different phrases. For example, the salesman was describing technology and sad that it's ever-changing. 

**Catherine:** Mm, okay, so this is, um, so a little poetic line here. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** So, uh, ever-changing means always changing. 

**Marco:** Uhu, always. 

**Catherine:** Always changing. And so we can say that the ocean is ever-changing. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** You know… 

**Marco:** Hehe. Right. 

**Catherine:** The waves are always changing and… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** Um, but in this case he's saying that technology is always changing, it's always progressing into something new and so… 

**Marco:** Exactly. 

**Catherine:** Uh, that is a key selling point for this guy. 

**Marco:** Right, so, uh, this is actually a very interesting word. We can use it like in your example beyond technology like the way… like the sea is ever-changing, so why don't we listen to a couple of other examples? 

**Example One** 

> A: There's always something new in this ever-changing world. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Times are ever-changing and we must prepare ourselves better everyday. 

**Example Three** 

> C: The flu is an ever-changing virus that continues to claim many lives. 

**Marco:** Alright, we're back, so now we understand ever-changing. 

**Catherine:** So the man who's trying to buy this computer or at least get his computer fixed, really starts to get frustrated with the salesman and he says: "Okay I know where this is going". 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** So he hears the sales pitch. He's hear… he hears this guy trying toloosen him up a little bit, he says "I know where this is going". So what does this mean this where something is going? 

**Marco:** So basically what direction a conversation or a topic or a situation is taking. 

**Catherine:** Okay, so he's saying "I know why you're telling me these things". 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** I know your motive. 

**Marco:** Or I know what's happening, I know what you're going to say. 

**Catherine:** Okay, so he's essentially saying "I know you're going to try and sell me a computer". 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** Alright. 

**Marco:** So, uh, you can use it in other circum… circumstances, right? For example, a relationship. 

**Catherine:** I don't know where this is going. 

**Marco:** Right, what… what is going? 

**Catherine:** Classic break up line. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** I just don't think I know where this is going anymore. 

**Marco:** Hehe. So in reference to the relationship, right? 

**Catherine:** Yeah, so… 

**Marco:** We don't know what's happening. Are we serious? Are we maybe gonna get married? I don't know anymore. 

**Catherine:** I can't tell where this movie is going, it's so like… ooh, let here and there and boring and… 

**Marco:** Yeah, you don't know the plot. 

**Catherine:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Alright. So it's a very common phrase and it sounds very natural when you say it, right? 

**Catherine:** It does. That's why in fluency builder it really helps you sound like a more native English speaker… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** When you use this kind of phrases. 

**Marco:** And the next one is also very, very good when he describes the… the condition of the computer, he says it's top of the line. 

**Catherine:** Top of the line. Now, what line we're talking about I do not know, but this is… 

**Marco:** Like above average line. 

**Catherine:** Right, so this is the best of the best. This is the top model or the top computer and, uh… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** You can definitely imagine a car salesman using this. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** Yes, this BMW is top of the line. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** The best money can buy. 

**Marco:** Yeah, that's another good one. So, basically, top of the line is the best of the best, the… above average, right? 

**Catherine:** More than above average. It's really… it's the best you can do and so… 

**Marco:** The best you can buy. 

**Catherine:** The guy is saying: "Listen, this is our best computer, really, you should buy it". And obviously… 

**Marco:** Usually… 

**Catherine:** Top of the line. Usually it costs a lot of money. 

**Marco:** Yeah. It's usually for… for something that costs money, right? For things. You wouldn't really use it for a person, right? He is top of the line. 

**Catherine:** No, no, no, no, no. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** Uh, top of the line, I think generally refers to electronics and cars. 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** Or like motorcycles and so, you often hear top of the line stereo, top of the line TV. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Um, top of the line car. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** But you wouldn't say this about food or… 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** People or art. Hehe. 

**Marco:** Yeah, you wouldn't say this… this painting is top of the line. 

**Catherine:** No, no. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** Not about like very unique things. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** You'd say this about kind of manufactured things. 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Very good, so we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases. Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, we are back, so, uh, computers. Catherine, I know you recently got a nice Macintosh. 

**Catherine:** Yeah, yeah, I did. 

**Marco:** It's one of those big screen ones, right? 

**Catherine:** Yeah, it is. It's a desktop, right… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** So it's not a laptop and, uh, it's got a very fast processor, because Macs started using Intel processors… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Catherine:** Couple of years ago and that made them much faster. 

**Marco:** Wow, and it has… this processor actually has two cores, right? 

**Catherine:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So basically it can has two different brains almost within one processor. 

**Catherine:** Which gives it really bad headaches. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** She complains to me often. 

**Marco:** Are you a big, uh, Mac fan or PC fan? 

**Catherine:** I'm a Mac fan. 

**Marco:** Really? 

**Catherine:** I've been converted. My roommate in college my sophomore year had a Mac and ever since then I've really gotten into them, so… 

**Marco:** Really? 

**Catherine:** Yeah, I went Mac and didn't turn back. 

**Marco:** I've… I still honestly cannot really use a Mac. I get confused, I'm looking for the s… for the start button and I'm looking for where my documents are. 

**Catherine:** It's really hard to change over, right? 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** But once you do is… you don't wanna change back, because everything is so much easier on a Mac. 

**Marco:** Really? 

**Catherine:** But if you're really into PC gaming, uh, then you should probablystick with it… stick with the PCs, because the games just don't really compare on Macs. 

**Marco:** But I've heard that also Macs don't really suffer from viruses, right? 

**Catherine:** No, they don't, which is great, cause I always used to get these viruses that would slow down my computer… 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** Cause, you know, you open some e-mail and all of a sudden… 

**Marco:** Yeah. 

**Catherine:** There's nastiness on your desktop. 

**Marco:** Hehe. 

**Catherine:** Well, now I don't really have that problem and, um, and also there's really wonderful photo editing software and video editing software. 

**Marco:** Right. 

**Catherine:** So everything is just really easy to find and easy to use. 

**Marco:** Mm, what about you listeners? Do you prefer the Mac? Do you prefer the PC? Or maybe some of our listeners don't really even like computers. 

**Catherine:** Well, let us know either way. We are very curious to hear, you have to say. And, or course, writing on our comments section is great practice for your English. 

**Marco:** Right, so we'll see you guys there and until next time… 

**Catherine:** Bye everyone! 

**Marco:** Bye!
