## New Guy In Town V

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today we're bringing you the next part of our suspense series The new guy in town. 

**Erica:** That's right. 

**Marco:** So, we know that Armand wasn't really a vampire, that he was just acting. 

**Erica:** And the women aren't quite what they seem in this dialogue. 

**Marco:** In the last one something happened and she transformed into some sort of, I don't know, creature, right? 

**Erica:** B… Monster. 

**Marco:** Right, so now, let's see what happens. So, we're not gonna preview any vocabulary this time, let's just listen to the dialogue and see what happens. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Erica:** Well, I don't think things are turning w… out very well for our housewives and Armand. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Apparently, the police officer is not gonna make it… 

**Erica:** Oh-oh. 

**Marco:** To the next episode. 

**Erica:** Oh-oh. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, we saw some really great vocabulary and even though it's kind of a scary story, there is a lot of things we can learn. So, why don't we take a look at it now in "language takeaway"? 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Erica:** We're gonna look at five words and phrases here and the first one, uh, they described this women as a kind of creature. 

**Marco:** Creature. 

**Erica:** Creature. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, what exactly is a creature? 

**Erica:** Well, a creature can be any animal. 

**Marco:** Any animal? 

**Erica:** Yeah, like from a mouse to a bird… to an insect or a bug. 

**Marco:** So, I can say a bird is a flying creature. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** But sometimes we also use it to mean an unknown and scary animal. 

**Marco:** So, there's a creature under my bad. 

**Erica:** Yes, or some type of creature was attacking me! 

**Marco:** Hehe. Okay, so, a creature can be any sort of living thing… 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Or animal. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Alright, what about our next one? 

**Erica:** Well, the creature broke free from some ropes. 

**Marco:** Alright, so, to break free. 

**Erica:** Break free. 

**Marco:** Aha, and what does that mean? 

**Erica:** When you break free, you escape from something that stops you moving. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, you have the ability to move again. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** You break free from maybe ropes. 

**Erica:** Or chains, or even a relationship. 

**Marco:** Okay, so… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I can say "Oh, I finally broke free from that awful relationship". 

**Erica:** Uhu. Now, that's quite interesting, the way we can use this in different ways. So, why don't we take a look at some examples now? 

**Example One** 

> A: We tied up the dog, but he's trying to break free. 

**Example Two** 

> B: I'm glad that I broke free from that horrible relationship. 

**Example Three** 

> C: I want to break free from all my daily responsibilities. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, break free. It's clear now. 

**Erica:** Uhu. So, why don't we move on to our next word? They though that maybe this creature was a kidnapper. 

**Marco:** Kidnapper. 

**Erica:** Kidnapper. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, this is… 

**Erica:** A criminal. 

**Marco:** So, a kidnapper is a criminal. 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Alright. And what exactly does a kidnapper do? 

**Erica:** A kidnapper takes someone to a place and keeps them there against their will. 

**Marco:** Against their will. 

**Erica:** With force or violence. 

**Marco:** Alright, so… so, I guess that makes sense, right? Because the word has "kid" in it… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, to take children. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** But it can be also… you can kidnap an adult. 

**Erica:** Yes, that's true. 

**Marco:** Alright. 

**Erica:** So, this word can actually be used in three different ways. So, we saw a kidnapper, right? 

**Marco:** Okay, that is the person. 

**Erica:** Yeah, and the verb - to kidnap. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Or a noun describing an action – a kidnapping. 

**Marco:** A kidnapping. 

**Erica:** So… 

**Marco:** Very good. 

**Erica:** Yeah, a kidnapping took place today. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, very interesting word and, of course, it's illegal to be a kidnapper. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** So, our next word is also very serious and it's also a crime, right? 

**Erica:** That's right. Rapist. 

**Marco:** A rapist. 

**Erica:** Rapist. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, that is a person that… 

**Erica:** Uhu, who forces someone to have sex. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, again, against their will… 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** Like a kidnapper. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, and the verb would be… 

**Erica:** To rape. 

**Marco:** To rape. 

**Erica:** To rape someone. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, on the lighter side we heard the police officer say something in a very strange way. He said "Lemme see you eyes, please". 

**Erica:** Okay, so, this is an interesting, uh, phrase, it's… it's a sound made from pushing two words together. 

**Marco:** Right, so, lemme. 

**Erica:** Why don't we hear a few more examples of this and see if we can figure out what are the two words? 

**Example One** 

> A: Lemme have a look inside the car. 

**Example Two** 

> B: Lemme go out tonight, dad, please! 

**Example Three** 

> C: Lemme think about it and I will give you an answer tomorrow. 

**Marco:** So, basically, "lemme" is… 

**Erica:** Let me. 

**Marco:** Let me. 

**Erica:** Yeah. Lemme have that pen. 

**Marco:** Okay, lemme see. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Now, we do this also with other words, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah, another example would be gimme. 

**Marco:** Gimme. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, that is "give me". 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, an interesting thing. It's not proper English, right? 

**Erica:** No, you wouldn't really write it this way, but… 

**Marco:** Or find it in the dictionary. 

**Erica:** But it's really common when people speak and actually it's more likely that you'll say "lemme", "gimme", than "let me", "give me". 

**Marco:** Okay, very good. So, I think now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the second time and then we'll come back and look at some other phrases that we saw in our dialogue. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** We're gonna look at two phrases now in "fluency builder" that you might hear when you're talking about a crime. 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** So, the first phrase that we're gonna look at is what the heck is going on. 

**Erica:** What the heck is going on. 

**Marco:** What the heck is going on. 

**Erica:** Okay, so, this is just asking what's happening, right? 

**Marco:** Right, but it's a very strong way of saying what's happening. 

**Erica:** Yeah. What really is happening. 

**Marco:** Aha, now, why do they say what the heck? What is heck? 

**Erica:** Well, heck is sort of a polite of saying hell. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, instead of saying what the hell is going on… 

**Erica:** What the heck is going on. 

**Marco:** Now, why do you do this? 

**Erica:** Um, because in… especially in American English, uh, we don't like to talk about religious words, so like… 

**Marco:** Uhu. 

**Erica:** Hell and God and Jesus – these things are, um, impolite in American English. 

**Marco:** Right, you don't wanna offend anyone. 

**Erica:** Right. 

**Marco:** So, that's why we would have other words like "oh, my gosh". 

**Erica:** For "oh, my God". 

**Marco:** Or Jeez. 

**Erica:** Instead of Jesus. 

**Marco:** Right. Okay… 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, that is an interesting thing and, of course, it's… it is a little bit of a sensitive topic… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Among some people, so, that's why it's better to just use these synonyms. 

**Erica:** Yes. 

**Marco:** Okay. And what about our next phrase? 

**Erica:** So, they suspected her of being a kidnapper. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, suspected her of being a kidnapper. 

**Erica:** Yeah, suspect someone of being something. 

**Marco:** Something. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, I suspect she is an alien. 

**Erica:** Right. I suspect him of being a liar. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, what about to suspect? What does that mean exactly? 

**Erica:** To think something that is true, but not be a hundred percent sure. 

**Marco:** So, you can say "I think she is a kidnapper". 

**Erica:** Yep. 

**Marco:** Or "I suspect her of being a kidnapper". 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Interesting. 

**Erica:** Why don't we hear a few more examples? 

**Example One** 

> A: The police suspected him of being a bank robber. 

**Example Two** 

> B: We suspect our dog is responsible for this mess. 

**Example Three** 

> C: The neighborhood suspected that our neighbor was selling drugs. 

**Marco:** Alright, very good, so, we've seen a lot of vocab, we've seen these phrases. So, I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Erica:** Okay, well, Marco, we're coming near the end of this series, aren't we? 

**Marco:** Yes, exactly. It's a short series, but what do you think happens… or how do you think the series ends? What is really going on? 

**Erica:** A mystery here at EnglishPod, so we want you… to hear from you what do you think is gonna happen.
