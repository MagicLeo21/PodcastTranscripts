## I Need More Time

---

**Marco:** Hello English learners! Welcome back to EnglishPod! My name is Marco. 

**Erica:** And I'm Erica. 

**Marco:** And today with Erica we're bringing you a great lesson about time. 

**Erica:** We need more of it. 

**Marco:** We need more time, right? 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** So, we're gonna be teaching you how you can ask for more time. 

**Erica:** If you're working on a project at work and you can't finish it on time, you have to ask your boss for more time. 

**Marco:** Right, so, today in our dialogue Casey needs more time to put together a press kit. 

**Erica:** What's a press kit? 

**Marco:** Good question. A press kit is something the marketing department will put together, basically, pictures, logos, um, all… information about the company. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** So, when a newspaper or a magazine wants to write an article about them, so, they have something already prepared that they could give the newspaper or magazine. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and as always it's gonna be at a normal speed, so, it might be a little bit difficult to understand. 

**Erica:** We'll come back in one minute and tell you about some of the key language. 

**DIALOGUE FIRST TIME** 

**Marco:** Alright, so, Casey is in trouble, I think. 

**Erica:** Yeah, I think her boss is pretty upset. 

**Marco:** Yeah, well, let's take a look at some of the language that we saw in this dialogue in "language takeaway". 

**Language Takeaway** 

**Marco:** First word today is deadline. 

**Erica:** Deadline. 

**Marco:** Deadline. 

**Erica:** Deadline. 

**Marco:** So, Erica, what's a deadline? 

**Erica:** It is the last possible date to do something. 

**Marco:** So, for example, when we were in school… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Our teacher would send us homework and say it was for Friday. 

**Erica:** So, the deadline was Friday. 

**Marco:** Was Friday. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Right? Or when you're at work you have projects that you have to finish by a certain date. That's your deadline. 

**Erica:** Exactly. 

**Marco:** Okay, let's look at our next word – extension. 

**Erica:** Extension. 

**Marco:** Extension. 

**Erica:** Extension. 

**Marco:** So, extension and deadline go together, right? 

**Erica:** Exactly, if you can't reach your deadline or you can't make your deadline, you must ask for an extension. 

**Marco:** An extension. So, you ask for more time. 

**Erica:** Yeah, an extension is moving the deadline in the future. 

**Marco:** Alright, interesting. Let's look at our next word – ran into. 

**Erica:** Ran into. 

**Marco:** Ran into. 

**Erica:** Ran into some problems. 

**Marco:** So, we ran into some problems in this dialogue. Let's listen to some more examples of run into, so we can understand the meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: We've ran into a storm on our way home. 

**Example Two** 

> B: If you're not careful now, you're going to run into a lot of problems later. 

**Example Three** 

> C: I ran into some trouble with my computer. 

**Marco:** Okay, good examples, so, it's clear now, right? 

**Erica:** Right, if you run into problems, you meet some problems. 

**Marco:** Right. Many students say it in that way "I met some problems". 

**Erica:** Yeah, but that's wrong. 

**Marco:** Right. So, you would say "I ran into some problems". 

**Erica:** Right, "I met some problems" is wrong, wrong, wrong. 

**Marco:** Okay, don't say "met some problems". 

**Erica:** I ran into some problems. 

**Marco:** I ran into, okay. And our last word for language takeaway – delayed. 

**Erica:** Delayed. 

**Marco:** Delayed. 

**Erica:** Delayed. 

**Marco:** So, when something is delayed, it's… 

**Erica:** Late. 

**Marco:** Late. 

**Erica:** And the opposite is… 

**Marco:** On time. 

**Erica:** Yeah, so, your flight was delayed. 

**Marco:** Or your flight was on time. 

**Erica:** The project was delayed. 

**Marco:** Or your project was on time. 

**Erica:** Clear. 

**Marco:** Alright. So, now let's go back to the dialogue. Let's listen to it again. 

**Erica:** And this time it'll be a little bit slower, so you can understand some of these phrases we just talked about. 

**DIALOGUE SECOND TIME** (slow) 

**Marco:** Okay, so, there were some really useful phrases that we saw in this dialogue. 

**Erica:** Yeah, some wonderful phrases that you can use when you want to ask for more time. 

**Marco:** Okay, so, let's look at these phrases in "fluency builder". 

**Fluency Builder** 

**Marco:** Alright, what's our first phrase? 

**Erica:** I've been meaning to talk to you. 

**Marco:** I've been meaning to. 

**Erica:** I've been meaning to. 

**Marco:** Okay, we have some really great examples of how you can combine I've been meaning to with different verbs. 

**Erica:** Yeah, let's listen. 

**Example One** 

> A: I'm sorry I haven't called you yet; I've been meaning to, but I've been busy. 

**Example Two** 

> B: I've been meaning to tell you, but John quit yesterday. 

**Example Three** 

> C: I've been meaning to see that film for a while. 

**Marco:** I've been meaning to go to that restaurant, but I haven't had time. 

**Erica:** So, you've been wanting to for a long time. 

**Marco:** Right. I've been thinking about it. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I've been planning to do it. 

**Erica:** But you just haven't done it. 

**Marco:** I haven't done it. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** Maybe because I haven't had time or money. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** Okay. Good phrase. 

**Erica:** Our next phrase is… beyond my control. 

**Marco:** Beyond my control. 

**Erica:** It's beyond my control. 

**Marco:** So, it means that I can't control it. 

**Erica:** You can't do anything about it. 

**Marco:** Can't do anything about it. The weather is beyond my control. 

**Erica:** Right. Or relate with this project: because Jane was sick for one month, it was beyond my control. 

**Marco:** Okay. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** It wasn't you fault. 

**Erica:** No. 

**Marco:** Okay. And our last phrase for fluency builder – put this off. 

**Erica:** Put this off. 

**Marco:** Put this off. 

**Erica:** Put this off. 

**Marco:** So, let's listen to some more examples of put this off before we explain the meaning. 

**Example One** 

> A: I've been putting off this project for a week and it's due tomorrow! 

**Example Two** 

> B: Can we put off our meeting to next week; I'm too busy right now. 

**Example Three** 

> C: I've been putting off my e-mail all day and now I have fifty messages to respond to! 

**Erica:** So, Marco, when you put something off, you… 

**Marco:** Leave it for later. 

**Erica:** Okay. 

**Marco:** Right? So, maybe I have to write a report today… 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**Marco:** But I'm gonna put it off till tomorrow. 

**Erica:** So, you're gonna do it tomorrow. 

**Marco:** I'll do it tomorrow. Okay, so we've seen some great words and some really good phrases, so, now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk some more. 

**Erica:** Uhu. 

**DIALOGUE THIRD TIME** 

**Erica:** Well, Marco, do you think that Casey's reasons for being late are good? 

**Marco:** I think so, because it wasn't really her fault, the whole situation with, uh, photographer and then one of her coworkers was sick for three weeks. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** It's not really her fault, right? 

**Erica:** Right, but maybe the boss thinks that she's making excuses. 

**Marco:** Yeah, maybe she's making excuses. That's really common like, for example, when we were kids, you would say "oh, you know, my dog ate my homework". 

**Erica:** Right, but… that… really happened to me once. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Your dog ate your homework? 

**Erica:** My cat ate my homework. 

**Marco:** Your cat ate your homework. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** And what did your teacher say? 

**Erica:** Well, actually I was a really good student, so, my teacher believed me. 

**Marco:** Hehe. Well, my teacher wouldn't have believed me. 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** No, no, she would've… she would've called my parents most likely. 

**Erica:** Yeah, well, my… my cat really did eat my homework. And… I just left it on the table and it chewed it at all. 

**Marco:** That's weird. Why would your cat do that? 

**Erica:** I don't know. 

**Marco:** A lot weir excuses out there. 

**Erica:** Yeah. 

**Marco:** I was abducted by aliens. 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** My mom accidentally mailed my homework to Africa. 

**Erica:** Really? 

**Marco:** Yeah, that was… 

**Erica:** Was it happen to you? 

**Marco:** Creative… 

**Erica:** Aha. 

**Marco:** Writing. 

**Erica:** Oh, Okay.
