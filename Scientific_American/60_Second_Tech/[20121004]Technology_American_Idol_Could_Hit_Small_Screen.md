Science and tech don't require the same skills as singing and dancing, but that hasn't discouraged TV producers from trying to make science and tech reality shows. The next one could be "American Idol for Tech," an idea being kicked around by American Idol judge Simon Cowell and pop star Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas.

Few details have been announced, but the show's rumored premise is to find the next great tech entrepreneur, according to the British paper the Sun.

Cowell had some success spotlighting tech entrepreneurs with the show American Inventor, which he produced in 2006 and 2007. And Will.i.am has been an outspoken supporter of science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, education. He also recently made headlines when his song "Reaching for the Stars" was broadcast from Mars to Earth courtesy of the Curiosity rover.

The success of any show about emerging tech moguls, however, would depend on finding over-the-top competitors with big ideas a la Steve Jobs, Mark Cuban and Larry Ellison. Clearly those people are out there. It's just a matter of getting them in front of a camera.
