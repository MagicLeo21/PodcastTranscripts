Given recent remarks made by certain members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, you might think Republicans are less science and tech savvy. Not so, at least when it comes to mobile gadgets and the upcoming elections, according to a Pew Internet & American Life Project study.

Pew found 88 percent of registered voters across the political spectrum own a cell phone. Many of these voters use those devices to get information about the 2012 election, to interact with the campaigns and to converse with other voters about politics.

Roughly half of survey respondents with a cell phone say it's a smart phone. About half of those smart phone owners used their device to access social network info about a candidate or campaign. Thirty-five percent used their smart phone to fact-check campaign claims. Eighteen percent used it to post political commentary to a social network.

Still, only eight percent use campaign apps offered by a candidate, political party or interest group. With smart phone use increasing among constituents, that number is guaranteed to grow by 2016.
