IBM predicts biometrics will replace most password use in the next five years. Larry Greenemeier reports

At the dawn of 2012, computer security looks a lot like it did five years ago—everything protected by a user ID and password. But that’s all set to change in the next five years. Instead of trying to remember passwords for dozens of online accounts—or worse, using the same password for all of them—more of us will rely on biometrics for protection.

At least that's IBM's vision. The company recently released its annual list of five predictions for five years into the future. Among them is the belief that facial definitions, eye scans, voice files and even DNA will safeguard personal identity and information, and replace the current memorization-based approach.

Some of these systems are already in use, but future developments will enhance the technologies, making them much more sensitive. Imagine voice and facial recognition sensors and software at an ATM refusing you access to your account because you look and sound under duress. Thinking that you the customer are possibly being robbed, it might even contact the police.
