The current “unplug” movement wants you to put down the smartphone and other devices. And it makes two major points worth considering. First: spend less time sharing pictures and video of what’s going on around you and more time enjoying the events themselves. Second, and more important: spend less time using your gadgets in ways that annoy the people around you.

Concerts are a particular focus here, although this idea could also apply to people texting in an otherwise dark movie theater. Comedian Demetri Martin has a joke about watching his favorite band…through the smartphone screen of the person in front of him.

A company called Yondr offers one way to get people to unplug during live performances. They sell a locking smartphone case that some venues in California use. Put your device in the case when you enter the club, and you can’t snap photos, take video, tweet or check e-mail unless you go to a designated area where the host can unlock it.

Peter Frampton would approve. The musician recently caused a minor stir by tossing a fan’s phone away during a concert. He’d be happy to know that, based on a YouTube search, nobody else at the show appears to have recorded the gadget-throwing incident using their smartphone.
