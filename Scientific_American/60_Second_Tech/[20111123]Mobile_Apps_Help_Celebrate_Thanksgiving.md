## Mobile Apps Help Celebrate Thanksgiving

Apps now can tell you when Snoopy will float by at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade or the best way to deep-fry your turkey. Larry Greenemeier reports

Thanksgiving is all about tradition. The Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. The Detroit Lions getting pummeled on national TV (they're playing undefeated Green Bay this year). The titanic turkey anchoring a meal with more food than most people eat in a week.

And for every Thanksgiving tradition, there's now a mobile app.

Start off the day with a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade App that lets you know when to expect your favorite floating cartoon characters.

For those wanting to get adventurous in the kitchen, there's the iFryTurkey app to help you deep fry your turkey without setting the kitchen on fire.

Other apps help you snap fancy holiday photos, tell bad jokes around the dinner table and interrupt mealtime conversation with digitally simulated turkey calls.

There are even apps for helping people navigate the most recent Thanksgiving weekend traditions: Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Find links to these apps in this story on sciam.com.

Of course, I don't need an app to remind me to be thankful for all of our listeners. Happy Thanksgiving!
