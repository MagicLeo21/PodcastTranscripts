Could the ultimate smart gadget for accessing the Web, messaging and making phone calls be...a pair of eyeglasses? We may know by the end of the year. That's when Google is expected to debut a heads-up display worn over the ears like a pair of specs.

The company is remaining hush on the project, but the The New York Times reports that these Google glasses will have a 3G or 4G data connection. They'll also have motion and GPS sensors, as well as a digital camera. You'd navigate from one feature to another simply by tilting your head.

The glasses, which would use Google's Android operating system, would not need to interface with a smart phone. They would actually be a smart phone that connects via Wi-Fi. That's according to the blog 9to5Google.

The prototype glasses being talked about have the heads-up display in only one lens, and that lens is not transparent. So wearers might be able to keep one eye on the world around them. Which might actually be an improvement for many smart phone users.
