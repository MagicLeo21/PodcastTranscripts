Since going public two years ago, Facebook has dialed up efforts to turn every “like,” “share” and “comment” into ad dollars. A billion-plus users is one thing, but the company’s now got shareholders to satisfy. So Facebook helps advertisers target its members via their personal information and preferences.

The social network now even has a strategy for exposing info about members who’ve kept their job or relationship status blank. Now another user can click the new “Ask” button and fill Facebook in on those details. So even if you’d hoped to keep a low profile, your nosy friends can raise it.

Facebook will also expand its successful video advertising strategy beyond the U.S. later this year. Users in Britain, Japan and five other countries will soon find these 15-second auto-play ads among posts from friends and family. That’s right—even your family messages will be sponsored.

The company also wants members to share more private info via mobile devices. Since Snapchat rejected its $3 billion acquisition offer, Facebook will now reportedly build its own video-messaging app called Slingshot. Perhaps an ironic name for a company that could be described as a Goliath.
