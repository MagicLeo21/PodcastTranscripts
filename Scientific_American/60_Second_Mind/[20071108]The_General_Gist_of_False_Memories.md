## The General Gist of False Memories

---

November 8, 2007

Duke University neuroscientists have found a distinction between memories for specifics versus memories for the overall gist of an event. The latter, the overall impression we have of something, tends to be the memory that is more often false.

Which do you trust more? A memory of a dinner party where you specifically recall sitting next to your pal Jake? Or a memory that it was just a fun time?

Duke University neuroscientists say that we’d trust both memories, a lot…even though the general impression type memories are more often false.

Researchers tested the memories of subjects using brain imaging through fMRI. They found that when subjects had high confidence in memories that were true, there was increased activity in their medial temporal lobe, at the base of the brain – the area that processes details of an event.

But when subjects had high confidence in memories for things that had never happened, they showed more activity in the frontal parietal network, at the top of the brain. An area that processes the overall feeling of an event.

As we age we tend to lose the ability to recall specifics but we do remember general impressions, however these are the ones that are often false…hm, how unfortunate.

Alzheimer’s patients tend to be different however, they lose both kinds of memories equally – this might be a useful tool for early diagnosis, the Duke researchers say.
