So it's Valentine's Day. And you still haven't got a date. Well, if you happened to be combing through the scientific literature for inspiration, you might just find it—in the form of a, quote, "systematic review on converting online contact into a first date." In other words, scientific ways to up your online dating game. The review is in the journal Evidence-Based Medicine. [Khalid S. Khan and Sameer Chaudhry: An evidence-based approach to an ancient pursuit: systematic review on converting online contact into a first date]

Some of these "evidence-based" tactics are obvious. Post an attractive profile pic. Be nice. Be funny. Others are less so. For example, pick a user name that starts with letters in the first half of the alphabet—A through M seem to up the odds. And when filling in your profile, keep in mind the golden 70/30 ratio: 70 percent stuff about you, 30 percent what you're looking for. A profile all about you might come across as self-absorbed.

As for photos, previous studies suggest a genuine smile and a slight head tilt will boost your appeal. And group photos that showcase the fact that other people have fun around you are a good thing—especially if you're in the center of the shot.

The researchers also write that women find men more attractive when they see other women smiling at him. Although my unscientific poll of a few female friends revealed that shots of other women smiling at you might be a no-no.

Last piece of advice—everyone thinks they're special. So don't just wink, or write "nice profile." Personalize your message. One of the more bizarre suggestions in that vein is to use rhyming in your note to a potential date. If her username is "fitandattractive," for example, the authors suggest writing that you're "very adaptive." Although that might seem a bit overactive.
