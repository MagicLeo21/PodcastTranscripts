A panic attack seems to come out of the blue. But new research

finds that the body gives unmistakable clues long before an

attack hits.

Scientists used mobile sensors to monitor the respiration and

heart rates of 43 panic attack sufferers for 24 hours during their

regular activities. And they found that subjects who wound

up having an attack actually had significant instability in their

physiology up to an hour before they felt the panic. The study is

published in the journal Biological Psychiatry.

The researchers found that subjects had no awareness of

increasing changes—like chest pain, dizziness, trembling, hot

flashes—until 60 minutes after the symptoms began.

Some panic attacks are predictable, like when a claustrophobic steps into a crowded elevator. But those who get unexpected attacks describe it as: I was just watching TV and I got a rush out of nowhere.

The study authors note that this lack of awareness may explain

why meds work better for sufferers than cognitive behavioral

therapy does: How is the patient supposed to work on

something that they are unaware is already in progress?
