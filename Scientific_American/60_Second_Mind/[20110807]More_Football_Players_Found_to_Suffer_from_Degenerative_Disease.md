## More Football Players Found to Suffer from Degenerative Disease

On February 17 former Chicago Bears football player Dave

Duerson killed himself with a gun shot to the chest.

Doctors later found that Duersonhad a condition in common with

more than 20 other dead football players in the U.S.: Chronic

Traumatic Encephalopathy or CTE, a degenerative disease linked to impulsive behavior, depression and dementia. And Duerson thought he had it. Which is why he took great care to leave his brain intact for study.

And concerns have been growing that the concussions and other

head injuries that are common in the NFL might be to blame.

The other week the Canadian Sports Concussion Project announced

the results from brain autopsies of four CFL football players.

Bobby Kuntz, a former Toronto Argonaut and Jay Roberts, who

played for the Ottawa Roughriders, showed classic signs of

CTE. But Peter Ribbons, a Winnipeg Blue Bomber, and Tony

Proudfoot, from the Montreal Alloettes, showed no signs. All

four played when it was common to spear opponents head-first

tackles.

The Canadian Project seeks more brain donations from former

contact sport athletes. To try to find out why some seem able to

avoid CTE, while others tragically are not.
